;  COFFBASD.TXT
;
;    This file defines the base addresses for the Gaming Controller CPL
;    components IN DEBUG BUILDS as they aren't defined elsewhere.
;    Ideally, these should be drawn from some global coffbase.txt but
;    DirectX does not have one and besides the CPL parts only get loaded
;    in one process space so should not be in the shared space.
;
;    The linker uses this file to generate the base address with the
;    following syntax:
;
;    -base:@coffbase.txt,kernel32
;
;    which is the same as:
;
;    -base:0xbff70000
;
;    
joy              0x2bf30000 0x000d0000
gchand           0x2be70000 0x000c0000
gcdef            0x2bd50000 0x000e8000
