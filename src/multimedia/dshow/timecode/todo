LTC decoder to do list!

-provide sample (sub-sample?) accurate location of LTC sync
 (may have to keep copy of raw samples in another cirsular buffer == fifo)

-work with any audio input format/rate (spec'd by a formatex?)!
 (this will require using pointer math to access samples)

-use the 1st derivative of the input signal to detect bit shape versus 
 amplitude
 (this will make us more robust to LTC levels)

-optimize code
 (may be able to sub-sample the signal to cut down on processing)

-work backwards audio as well as forward (from tapedeck in reverse)

-verify based on parity?
