as part of the security push we've deleted the following files.  
if anyone wants them back they should do a full security review


elementbehaviorimpl.h
htmlpainterimpl.h
msvidctl\rbfactory.h

these were used as the beginning of an attempt to expose vidctl as a binary element behavior.  
but this was never completed, and to reduce our security footprint and not have to implement
zone checking/security manager awareness for this method of object instantiation, we're just
taking it out altogether.
