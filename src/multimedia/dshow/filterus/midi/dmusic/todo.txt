Remaining work items:

* IMediaSeeking

* Bypass performance, segment objects and do our own MIDI parsing, note messages straight to the port.

* Performance

  - Responsiveness to Active() too slow! The DirectMusic objects need to be created on the same thread as they are accessed, otherwise DirectMusic-related start dying.

  - Running the graph, stopping the graph, then rerunning the graph DM ports are messed up

* Extras
  - Property sheets displaying DirectMusic-performance information, latency times
  - Why does ASYNC->DMUSIC->WAVDEST (sdk sample)->File Writer not work?
