# NOTE:
# this directory contains a makefile which contains a single line that
# includes the global build process makefile.def. If the
# NTTARGETFILE1 or NTTARGETFILE0 environment
# variable is set then makefile.def includes makefile.inc from the current
# directory. This makefile.inc creates an extra target for nmake to create
# when it is run. NTTARGETFILE0 is built before everything else, and
# NTTARGETFILE1 is built after everything else.
