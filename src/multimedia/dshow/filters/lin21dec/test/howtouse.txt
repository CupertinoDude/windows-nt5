Introduction:
============
This is a short doc on how to use the Test Line21 Source Filter (TSrcL21) to 
test the Line21 Decoder Filter (Lin21Dec).


Purpose:
========
Right now we don't have any line21 data source.  The Test Source filter has
been created to do some preliminary testing of the features and correctness
of the Line21 Decoder filter.  So far it has been very useful and effective
for this purpose.

How It Works:
============
It's simple.  It's a 3 step method.
a) Instantiate a TSrcL21, a Lin21Dec and a Video Renderer in a graph 
   (e.g, using GraphEdt). TSrcL21 asks for a .L21 filename on startup.
b) Connect TSrcL21's output to Lin21Dec's input; then connect Lin21Dec's 
   output to the Video Renderer's input. 
c) Now play, pause, stop -- whatever you want.
Note: TSrcL21 doesn't do seeking.  So when the play send, you have to 
----  reinstantiate TSrcL21 (and specify the .L21 input file name) again and 
      connect the pins.  It may be some work to do seek back to beginning.

.L21 Files:
==========
These files are plain text file to be created using text editors like Edit,
Notepad etc (which put a CR-LF for a lind end).  These files are to be used
as the input to TSrcL21.  By varying the contents of these files a vast
amount test cases can be covered for Lin21Dec.  It's not necessary to write
a lot of code to test Lin21Dec.
Note: There are a few rules about the .L21 files, but imagination is the
----  only limit for the usefulness of this approach.

.L21 Rules:
==========
I had to create a few "rules" or syntax for the input files used for TSrcL21.
1. The first line should be
   #SubType={BytePair|GOPPacket}
   This line indicates to TSrcL21 that the data should be sent down either as
   byte pairs or as GOP packets (as in DVD). Not having this line will cause
   TSrcL21 to have an invalid media type and it won't connect to Lin21Dec.

2. If the SubType on line 1 has been specified as "GOPPacket" then the
   second line should be of the form
   NewPacket n
   where n is an integer in the range 1 to 53 (DVD's max for a packet). Each
   such line indicates the beginning of a new GOP packet of caption chars.
   There can be multiple such packets each starting with a "NewPacket n" line.
   For subtype "BytePair", this line should not be used.

3. The text chars are to be typed in as it is with a max of 32 chars per 
   line.  It's a good test case to have more than 32 chars on a line as 
   Lin21Dec should handle that right.

4. The control chars, special chars etc are in the range 10 hex to 7f hex.
   So they are put in [ ] to distinguish them from a normal number. A control
   char pair [14 20] has to be used to indicate that the caption mode is
   Pop-on.

There are a bunch of .L21 files checked in in the 
\quartz\filters\lin21dec\test\data dir.  Take a look at them to get an idea
of how these files should be created. Use these files as input to create
filter graphs and play them back.  See the correspondence between the control
chars and color/font/mode etc change in the displayed caption.

Finally:
=======
You need to read about 10 pages of doc on Closed Captioning.  I have a copy
of the doc 
"Closed Caption Decoder Requirements from FCC Report and Order FCC 91-119".
This is the minimum you will need to know to create meaningful L21 files
for testing Lin21Dec.  If you get more interested in it, you can also raed
EIA-608, but it's a pin-in-the-****.  So try avoiding it if you can.


Feedback:
========
Please let me know of any problem/concerns/requirements/... whatever (praise
is fine too :-).
