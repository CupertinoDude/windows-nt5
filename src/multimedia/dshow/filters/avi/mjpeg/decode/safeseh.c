/*
 *  The trampoline is a small stub that we put up in shared memory
 *  which merely jumps to the real exception handler.  Why do we
 *  do this?  Because on Windows 95, if you take an exception while
 *  the Win16 lock is held, Kernel32 will not dispatch to any
 *  private-arena exception handlers.  This rule is enforced because
 *  application exception handlers are not Win16-lock-aware; if we
 *  let them run, they won't release the Win16 lock and your system
 *  would hang.
 *
 *  And then DirectDraw showed up and broke all the rules by letting
 *  Win32 apps take the Win16 lock.
 *
 *  By putting our handler in the shared arena, we are basically saying,
 *  "We are Win16 lock-aware; please include me in the exception chain."
