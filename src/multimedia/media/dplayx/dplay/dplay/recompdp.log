 *
 *		If this file is ever updated, all files for DirectPlay
 *		will recompile. (forces an nmake clean).
 *
 *		Add a record telling why the recompile was needed, and
 *		a global recompile will occur for all of the DirectDraw
 *		components.
 *
 *		This saves the pain in the ass of having a dependancy on
 *		globally included headers files and forcing a recompile
 *		every time you change it.
