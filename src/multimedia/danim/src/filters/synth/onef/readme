NOTE:  You need to have quartz strmbase.lib built and installed in 
d:/nt/public/sdk/lib/i386 for this directory to build.

Enlist ghosted to quartz ghosted: 
    cd d:/
    mkdir quartz
    cd quartz
    enlist -g -s "\\trango\slmadd" -p quartz

Unghost the critical bits:
    cd sdk/classes/base/
    ssync -ur

Then build the bits (the libs auto propagate)
    dabuild b -sbmM
