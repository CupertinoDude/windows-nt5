Instructions:

Your dxmedia.cab drop failed the BVT tests because the files were packaged under ms\dxmedia instead of com\ms\dxmedia.  This is an easy mistake with dubuild; I've appended the following example of a session that builds a CAB and checks it to ensure it is packaged right.

The OSD file above is automatically generated by DUBUILD.  It contains a list of all Java packages found and sets the version number to be 1.0.0.0.

Make sure that your packages are in the com\ms subdirectory as seen above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we need to call in COM, we have to be trusted classes, part of the system.

You need to add the parameters -S * to your command line to mark all packages as SYSTEM packages:

	C> dubuild dajava.cab dajava -S * ...
