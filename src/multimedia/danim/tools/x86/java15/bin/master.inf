; This file is separated into sections; be sure to make the 
; necessary changes in each one.
; See the SDK for Java documentation (under Tools) for information on
; using this file with the cabarc.exe utility to distribute Java classes.  

[hook1]

; In this line, replace CabFileName.cab with the inner CAB file name
; that contains your classes.  

run=extrac32.exe /e /a /y /l %49000% CabFileName.cab

; Change the name of master.inf to the name you are assigning this

; Running guidgen in the SDK generates the ClassId you need to fill 
; in here. This classId also goes in the OBJECT tag.
; Don't forget the set braces!

ClassId="{99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999}"

; Put the name by which your packages should be referred to 
; (i.e. "Bob's Text Viewer") here.

; Leave this line.
HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\%ClassId%",,,"%PackageName%"

; Replace <aa...> with the version number (like 1,0,0,1) of this
; version of your library. This is so that when you want to update
; your libraries, you can change the version rather then the classId
; and the problems that go with that. If the version number here
; and in the OBJECT tag match the version already stored on the
; user's machine, it will not download the classes again, which
; also saves time and energy.

HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\%ClassId%\InstalledVersion",,,"aa,bb,cc,dd"

; Here, replace <filename> with the name of one of the class files in
; your package, including the virtual path (specified in classpck.ddf)
; to that file. This will make sure that the classes exist on the
; user's system; if they don't, they will be downloaded, regardless
; of version numbers.

HKLM,"Software\Classes\CLSID\%ClassId%\InstalledVersion","Path",,"%49000%\<filename>"

; Leave these keys alone.

HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\%ClassId%\InProcServer32",,,"%11%\MSJAVA.DLL"

HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\%ClassId%\InProcServer32","ThreadingModel",,"Both"


; Under most circumstances, you should leave the next two keys alone.
; Only change them if
; 1) You have not expanded the classes into their subdirectories on
; the user's machine, but have instead stored them in an uncompressed
; .ZIP file; in that case, change the appropriate value
; to "%49000%\<ZipFileName>".
;
; 2) You have decided to install the files onto another, hard-coded
; directory of your choice. This is not recommended, for you will
; clutter up the user's directories and have to make other changes.
; If you do so, though, change the appropriate value to the absolute
; pathname to that directory, and change it in the run= line above.
;
; If you use one of these, you will use exactly one.
