A range of FACILITY_INTERNET has been reserved for IIS components. IIS
components may use values between 0xc800 and 0xcbff in the "code" field
of an HRESULT.

Since there is no automated way to enforce this range (and protect against
duplicate codes) this text file tracks code usage. Whenever a new component
needs to allocate codes within the IIS range, please update this file.

.MC files used to generate HRESULTs allocated from this range should be of
the following format:

    SeverityNames=(Success=0x0,
                   CoError=0x2
                   )

    FacilityNames=(Internet=0xc
                  )

    Messageid=0xc??? Facility=Internet Severity=CoError SymbolicName=WHATEVER
    Language=English
    Your message goes here.
    .

Also, ensure the .MC file is compiled with "mc -o {other_switches}". The
-o switch tells MC.EXE to generate an "OLE-style" header file.
