; This file is used to specify where every file built by the NT build lab is
; binplaced relative to the root of the distribution point.  If a file is not
; listed, it will end up in the dump directory.
;
; The format is like this:
;
; <imagename>    <class name>
;
; where <imagename> is the filename.ext and <class name> is the directory off
; the root of the distribution point (retail is a placeholder for the root).
; If there are multiple class names for a single image, use a colon to separate
; each.
;
; All bits that ship in the NT base product and are installed with winnt32,
; must have a class name of retail.
;
; If you add a new file to the list, please refrain from creating your own
; special section.  Doing so makes it difficult to detect duplicates.  If
; you're unable to add your image due to a collision with an existing name,
; work it out with the other developer.  Options include creating another
; placefil.txt for your project or using the ALT_PROJECT_TARGET macro in your
; sources file to change the base of the distribution point (doing so means
; your project will not install as part of base NT).
;
;     sort /+17 < placefil.txt > placefil.srt
;
; will generate a list sorted by class name if you want.
