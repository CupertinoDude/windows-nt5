1. Context object should fire internal change notification events - ***DONE***

2. Connection cache? [AppCntr/Runtime RAID DCR #54319]

3. Enums - are they at the correct scope? 

4. Can all our Clone implementations have a "strongly typed" 
   override e.g. for ManagementObject

	object ICloneable.Clone ()
	ManagementObject Clone()

5. Can ManagementObject, Class etc. take a scope as a string

6. Make sure ToString and Equals are implemented consistently

7. What are the rules for overlapping paths in ManagamentObject,
   Class and Searcher constructors that take scope and path.
   ***Currently resolved as follows : if a scope is specified, it overrides any other scope specified in the path.***
   ***If no scope is specified, the scope used is the one specified in the path.***
   ***If the path is a relative path (no scope), the default scope path is used.***

8. SelectClassQuery is missing the (condition, propLIst) constructor - ***NO NEED BECAUSE SELECT CLASS DOESN't ALLOW PropList

9. Do we need a way to say - "have the ConnectionOptions leave the
    authn level and imp level at their currently assigned values"? ***DONE***

10. EnablePrivileges not working correctly yet.

11. Check all classes that we allow people to subclass, and make sure
    it is clear that they know exactly what they have to do when
    subclassing. (e.g. Parsing and Building queries)

12. When URT builds catch up in VS, check that the fix for interop
    marshaling of VT_DISPATCH|VT_ARRAY's works ok (45235)

13. Which objects are Component's. How do they appear in the IDE?

14. When URT builds catch up in VS, check whether we can dispense
    with the WBEMSinkDemultiplexor and use IWbemObjectSink directly
    with some attribution.

15. Dispense with wbemutilities_v1 by providing the wrappers manually. [AppCntr/Runtime RAID DCR #48803]

16. Dispense with wbemclient_v1 by providing the wrappers manually. [AppCntr/Runtime RAID DCR #48803]

17. Extended error objects: will need to supress HRESULTS->COMEXception 
    from interop and use PInvoke to get the error object. [AppCntr/Runtime RAID DCR #55369]

18. What to do with CaseInsensitiveHashTable? ***Resolved - this class was deprecated and we are not using it any more***

19. Security issues with running from ASP+ on NT4. Do we support this
    configuration? 

20. Possibly add an API to Searcher that returns a single object

21. Code-Access Security integration !! For v1.0 currently decided we do not need to do anything in this respect. 
	This is still pending some testing of remote scenarios with WinForms/WebForms to see how and whether this strategy
	limits WMI usage.

22. GetRelated constructors?? (assoc class vs. endpoint class) [AppCntr/Runtime RAID DCR #54545]

23. Support multiple enumerators on methods [AppCntr/Runtime RAID DCR #55371]
