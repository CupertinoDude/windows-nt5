7) check for If-* headers and other evil headers (like Translate)

11) default memory size algorithm

other good stuff:

1) perf counters
2) cache browsing api
3) more stats and instrumentation
4) better table size computations ( would like prime # of buckets ).
5) look-aside lists for frequently allocated resources
7) smarter config based (and tree) invalidation
