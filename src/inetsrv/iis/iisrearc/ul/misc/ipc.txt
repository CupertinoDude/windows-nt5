// Issues:
//
//      What if the response is too large for the supplied buffer?
//
//      What about entity body data (send & receive)?
//
//      Security?
//
//      What type of handle do we use? An App Pool hadnle seems
//          rather unnatural, but a Control Channel handle is
//          out of the question. Maybe we need an IPC handle?
