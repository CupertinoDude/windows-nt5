This directory contains temporary scripts to install UL.SYS to and remove
UL.SYS from a test machine.

Note: These scripts require that REGINI.EXE and SC.EXE be on your path.

Note: These scripts just muck with the service controller and registry
settings; they don't actually copy UL.SYS onto your test machine. UL.SYS
must be copied to the %windir%\system32\drivers directory before use.

Execute INSTALL.BAT to install UL.SYS, REMOVE.BAT to remove it. Duh.
