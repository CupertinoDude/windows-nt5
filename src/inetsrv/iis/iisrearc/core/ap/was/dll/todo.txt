CODEWORK: Here are a number of things we need to do in WAS (and in IIS+
more generally in some cases) before ship:


Review all metabase settings we inherited from IIS5, to make sure we implement
them in IIS+ (or explicitly choose to punt). 

Rename everything (dlls, event source name, service name, etc.) to final 
product names.

Sync up iisutil sources to the final, shipping IIS5 sources from which they
were forked (has this already been done??).

Adjust all default configuration settings to the desired values for ship. This 
includes default values for settings read from the config store, but also values
for things that are hardwired in the code (low mem limits, etc.).

Review all strings that show to the customer, for example event log messages.
