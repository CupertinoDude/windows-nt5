<h2>Recyclable Worker Processess</h2><p>In dedicated application mode, IIS can be configured to
periodically restart worker processes in an application pool,
allowing you precise management of those that are faulty. This
ensures that specified applications in those pools remain healthy,
and that system resources can be recovered. Applications can be
restarted based on elapsed and scheduled times, number of requests
served, response to a ping, virtual memory usage, and on demand. To
recycle a worker process, the faulty worker process is spun down
until it completes processing all remaining requests it has stored
in the request queue. The process is given a configured time to
drain its current requests. Simultaneously, WAS creates a
replacement worker process for the same namespace group, and the
new worker process is started before the old worker process stops.
This prevents service interruptions. The old process remains in
communication with the kernel-mode driver to complete its
outstanding requests, then shuts down normally or is explicitly
terminated if it does not shut down after a configurable time
limit.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
