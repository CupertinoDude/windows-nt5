<h2>Key Names and Paths</h2><p>A metabase key is a location in the metabase analogous to a
directory in the file system. A metabase path is a sequence of keys
separated by a forward slash (/) that uniquely identifies the
location of a key in the metabase. Key names in the metabase are
not unique unless qualified by their metabase paths, just as
different files with the same name can exist in different
directories.</p><p>You can use the path of a metabase key with the IIS Admin
Objects to access the specific IIS Admin Object associated with
that key. The IIS Admin Objects use the Active Directory Service
Interfaces (ADSI) path, called the <b>ADsPath</b>, to refer to the
object associated with a key. The path starts with IIS:// and then
uses the term LocalHost, or a specific computer name, to refer to
the <b>IIsComputer</b> object, which is associated with the highest
key in the metabase. For more information about the IIS Admin
Objects, see <a href="prog_use_using.htm"><b>Using IIS Admin Objects</b></a>.</p><p>The paths to objects associated with other metabase keys are an
extension of the <b>ADsPath</b> to the computer key. For example,
the <b>ADsPath</b> for the first Web site in your IIS installation
would be IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC/1. You could also use the path
IIS://<i>ComputerName</i>/W3SVC/1 to access the metabase on a
different computer.</p><p>Each Web site is a server instance, and is referred to in the
path by its number. For example, IIS://LocalHost/MSFTPSVC/3
represents the third FTP server instance, and
IIS://<i>ComputerName</i>/W3SVC/4 represents the fourth Web server
instance.</p><p>Each Web site has an associated root virtual directory. All
other virtual directories and directories associated with a server
instance are subordinate to this root virtual directory. The name
of the root virtual directory is ROOT.
IIS://LocalHost/MSFTPSVC/3/ROOT refers to the root virtual
directory for the third FTP server on the local computer, and
IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC/4/ROOT refers to the root virtual directory
for the fourth Web server on the same computer.</p><p>You can establish the structure below the root virtual directory
of a server instance by adding virtual directories, directories,
and files. For FTP servers, metabase properties can be set to the
virtual-directory level. For Web servers, you can set properties to
the level of directories and files. For example, you could use the
path IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC/2/ROOT/MyVdir1/Dir1/File1 to set file
properties such as read, write, and execute permissions.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
