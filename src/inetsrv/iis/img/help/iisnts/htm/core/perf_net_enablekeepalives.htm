<h1>Enabling HTTP Keep-Alives</h1><p>Most Web browsers ask the server to keep the connection open
across multiple requests. This is referred to as HTTP Keep-Alives.
Keep-Alive is an HTTP specification that allows for greatly
enhanced server performance. Without it, a browser has to make
numerous connection requests for a page containing multiple
elements, such as graphics. A separate connection may need to be
made for each element. These additional requests and connections
require additional server activity and resources, decreasing server
efficiency. They also make a browser much slower and less
responsive, especially across a high-latency (slow) connection.
HTTP Keep-Alives are enabled by default during the installation
process.</p><p><b>To disable HTTP Keep-Alives</b></p><ol><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select the Web site, and open its property
sheets.</li><li>On the <b>Web Site</b> property sheet, clear the <b>HTTP
Keep-Alives Enabled</b> check box.</li></ol><hr class="iis" size="1">
