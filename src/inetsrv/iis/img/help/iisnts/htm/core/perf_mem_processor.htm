<h1>Processor Utilization</h1><p>This section focuses on processor aspects of performance and
makes recommendations for upgrades, based on feedback from
performance monitoring tests.</p><h2><a name="IdentifyingProcessorBottlenecks">Identifying Processor
Bottlenecks</a></h2><p>The CPU does the actual processing of instructions received by
the computer. Information moves between the various components of
the computer, such as the CPU, hard disk, and RAM, depending on the
clock speed of the CPU and the size of the data bus the CPU uses to
move the information. Faster clock speeds mean that more trips are
made back and forth by the data bus during the same time interval.
Clock speeds are usually expressed as megahertz (MHz). The data bus
can carry 16, 32, or 64 bits of data on each trip, depending on the
bus size. (How much data is carried is also a function of the
operating system used and what transfer rate the application is
based on.)</p><p>Processor bottlenecks are characterized by very high CPU %
Utilization numbers while the network adapter card remains well
below capacity. If CPU % utilization is high, you can:</p><ul><li>Upgrade the CPU.</li><li>Add additional CPUs to the same computer.</li><li>Replicate the site on another computer and distribute traffic
across both computers.</li><li>Move processor-intensive applications such as database
applications to another computer.</li></ul><h2><a name="ThrottlingUseoftheCPU">
Throttling Processes Overview</a></h2><p>You can limit the percentage of time the CPU spends processing
out-of-process WAM, ISAPI, and CGI applications for individual Web
sites by enabling process throttling. Limiting access to the CPU is
useful if you host multiple sites on one computer and you are
concerned about out-of-process applications on one site using all
of the CPU capacity, thereby preventing other sites from using
it. </p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>For instructions on how to set up process
throttling, see <a href="perf_mem_throttling.htm"><b>Throttling Processes</b></a>.</p>
<p>If a restricted site's out-of-process applications use more than
the assigned percentage of processor time during a specified time
interval, the event is logged and consequences occur based on the
amount of overrun of the assigned percentage. The consequences
are:</p><ul><li><b>Level 1</b> An event is written to the
Windows Whistler Event Log when the total processor use over
the specified time period exceeds the limit.</li><li><b>Level 2</b> If the processor use exceeds 150 percent of
the limit, an event is written to the Event Log, and all the
out-of-process applications on that Web site have their CPU
priority set to Idle.</li><li><b>Level 3</b> If the processor use exceeds 200 percent of
the limit, an event is written to the Event Log, and all the
out-of-process applications on that Web site are stopped.</li></ul><p>Once a site has reached a Level 2 or Level 3 consequence, the
consequence remains in effect until the next time interval. For
example, if a site's out-of-process applications are restricted to
10 percent of the CPU processing time during a 24-hour interval,
the site's applications should be using the CPU for only 2.4 hours
out of 24. If the site uses the CPU longer than 2.4 hours, but less
than 3.6 hours, the only consequence is that an event is written to
the Event Log. Once the site uses the CPU for more than 3.6 hours,
all out-of-process applications on the site are set to Idle. If the
server is not very busy and the applications continue to use
processor time, eventually reaching 4.8 hours of use during the
24-hour interval, the out-of-process applications are stopped on
the Web site.</p><p>Process accounting is reset at the end of the 24-hour period and
the site returns to normal functioning. Administrators can return a
site to normal functioning sooner by changing the percentage set
for a Web site, or by stopping and restarting the site. Web site
Operators do not have permission to change this setting. For
information on setting process restrictions, see <a href="perf_mem_throttling.htm"><b>Throttling Processes</b></a>. For
information on process accounting, see <a href="log_aboutlogging.htm"><b>About Logging Site Activity</b></a>. For
information on how to enable an additional consequence level and
how to change process throttling time intervals by using scripts
and the metabase, see <a href="prog_use_using.htm"><b>Using IIS Admin Objects</b></a>.</p><p>If you enable process throttling, then you should probably lower
the CGI timeout interval. By default, the interval is set to 5
minutes. If the CGI applications fails, the thread is not released
until the timeout value is reached. The time between failure and
when the thread is finally released is counted as time that the
application is using the processor. The CGI timeout in IIS 6.0 is
the total amount of time a CGI application is given to complete,
not the time until I/O must occur. For instructions on how to
change the CGI timeout, see <a href="ca_cachingapps.htm"><b>Caching Applications</b></a>.</p><div><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li>For a list of all timeout values that can be set by IIS, see <a href="ref_we_timeouts.htm"><b>Timeouts Reference</b></a>.</li></ul></div><hr class="iis" size="1">
