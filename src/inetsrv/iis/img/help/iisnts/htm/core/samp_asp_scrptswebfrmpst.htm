<h2>User Form Input with POST</h2><h6>Overview</h6><p>The most basic form of interactivity on the Web is probably the
HTML form. It is important to note that ASP does not replace forms,
but rather enhances them, and makes them easier for you to
implement and manage.</p><p>The HTML &lt;FORM&gt; tag specifies what method the form will
use to convey information to the processing script. The <b>POST</b>
method attribute indicates that information from the form will be
passed to the processing script or program through a separate HTTP
connection. The processing script or program can parse the
information and do whatever task is required, and return output to
the client browser.</p><h6>Code Tour</h6><p>This example demonstrates how to implement a simple form by
using the HTML <b>POST</b> method attribute, as well as one key
benefit of creating forms with ASP: the ability to combine the form
and the actual processing code into the same file. This sample
creates a small form with two text input boxes, one for the user's
first name (<i>fname</i>) and one for his or her last name
(<i>lname</i>). The <b>Request.Forms</b> collection is accessed to
get the value of the <i>fname</i> and <i>lname</i> variables from
the request, and the results are displayed at the bottom of the
page.</p><p>The first time you run this script, no text will be displayed
below the horizontal line. This is because no form information was
available to pass to this script when it started, and ASP ignores
searches of <b>Request.Forms</b> for information that does not
exist. However, if you press the Submit button, the page is
reloaded and the information you entered into the text boxes is
available to the script.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
