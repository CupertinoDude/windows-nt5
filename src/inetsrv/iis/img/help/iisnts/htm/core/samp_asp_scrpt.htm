<h1>ASP Script Examples</h1><p>Active Servers Pages (ASP) is one of the features that make IIS
the premier Web server. Never before has it been so easy to create
useful, interactive, Web-based applications, even if you have
relatively little experience with programming. If you are a more
advanced user, ASP provides a way to rapidly create sophisticated
and robust Web applications without dedicating the often
substantial resources required for development in a more
conventional programming language environment, such as C++ or
Java.</p><p>This section provides an overview of the capabilities of
server-side scripting in general, and ASP in particular, while at
the same time providing more advanced examples for experienced
developers who want to discover what ASP can do for them.</p><p>For each sample script, you will be provided a menu bar with
which you can:</p><ul><li>Read the overview to find out what the sample demonstrates, how
it works, and what to look for.</li><li>View the source. The sample scripts, provided in both VBScript
and JScript, are well documented and carefully organized.</li><li>Run the VBScript version of the sample.</li></ul><p>Sample scripts provided in this documentation are divided into
several categories:</p><ul><li><a href="samp_asp_scrptsmpl.htm"><b>Simple Scripts</b></a>: Learn the
basics of script syntax, flow control, functions, and
procedures.</li><li><a href="samp_asp_scrptsbld.htm"><b>Building ASP Applications</b></a>:
Study samples that demonstrate the structure and function of a
Web-based application.</li><li><a href="samp_asp_scrptsweb.htm"><b>Web Interactivity using ASP</b></a>: Discover how to make your application more useful and
versatile by incorporating cookies, client-side scripting, and
other techniques.</li><li><a href="samp_asp_scrptsuic.htm"><b>Using Installable Components</b></a>: Learn how to leverage the functionality provided by
the Active Server Pages components that are installed with
IIS.</li><li><a href="samp_asp_scrptsdbc.htm"><b>Database Connectivity</b></a>:
Explore examples that illustrate the power of the bundled database
access component, ActiveX<sup>®</sup> Data Objects (ADO).</li><li><a href="samp_asp_scrptstxn.htm"><b>ASP Transaction Services</b></a>:
Study samples that demonstrate the alliance between Component
Services and ASP scripts.</li></ul><p>Although the samples in this section are provided as an
educational resource, this is not a tutorial on ASP scripting or
application creation. For more information, see <a href="asp_asp.htm"><b>Getting Started with ASP</b></a> and <a href="dwa_dwa.htm"><b>Developing Web Applications</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
