<h1>Disk Optimization</h1><p>Optimizing the number of times Internet Information Services
(IIS) accesses the hard disk can greatly improve performance by
reducing hard-disk bottlenecks. Optimizing disk access involves
monitoring memory requirements and determining the size and number
of files being requested. Hard-disk bottlenecks are most often seen
on sites with very large file sets that are accessed randomly. If
your server has a small amount of RAM and either a large number of
different files are being requested, or the size of the requested
files is large, IIS is unable to maintain copies of the files in
RAM for faster access. In this case, IIS must access the files from
the hard disk. The access speed and size of the hard disk determine
how quickly IIS can locate a requested file.</p><p>To monitor your disk drives, use System Monitor to log the
percentage of CPU utilized, network card saturation, and the % Disk
Time counter of the Physical Disk object. If the % Disk Time
counter is high, but the CPU and network card are not saturated,
the disk drive is creating a bottleneck. For more information on
Physical Disk % Disk Time, see the Windows Whistler
documentation.</p><p>To improve disk access, use a redundant array of independent
drives (RAID) and striped disk sets. If your server is used heavily
for database work, you may want to consider running IIS on a
different machine because your database will compete with IIS for
memory, CPU, and disk resources. If you must run IIS on the same
machine as your database server, you may need either gigabytes of
RAM to minimize access delays, or a drive controller with a large
RAM cache. You should also maintain redundancy, so that you are not
forced to restore from backup copies when a single drive ceases to
function. Many newer controllers permit "hot swapping," so that
when a drive fails, it can be replaced without forcing server
downtime.</p><div><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li>For more information on monitoring server performance, see <a href="perf_mon.htm"><b>Performance Monitoring</b></a>.</li><li>For more information on counters related to performance, see <a href="ref_we_counters.htm"><b>Counters Reference</b></a>.</li></ul></div><hr class="iis" size="1">
