<h1>Using Passport Authentication</h1><p>Passport's primary service is user authentication, referred to
as the Passport single sign-in (SSI) service. Passport supports
authentication across multiple sites and services by hosting:</p><ul><li>A secure central database that contains users' authentication
credentials</li><li>The registration and sign-in/sign-out pages, which Passport
participating sites can cobrand.</li></ul><p>When a registered Passport user clicks the standard Passport
sign-in scarab on a Passport SSI participating site, a silent HTTP
redirect displays the (cobranded) Passport sign-in page. On the
sign-in page, the user enters his or her Passport sign-in name and
password. Passport authenticates the user, writes Passport cookies
to the user's browser, and provides encrypted authentication (a
"ticket" containing the PUID) and Passport profile information to
the participating site as parameters on the HTTP query string. A
simple server-side COM object, called the Passport Manager, on the
participating site decrypts the information, manages authentication
and profile access, caches the user's authentication and profile
information in cookies on the user's browser, and silently
re-verifies the cookies as the user moves from page to page at the
site. The site may use information in the profile cookie to
personalize the user's experience in some way (for example, by
displaying the user's name or special offers targeted to the user's
demographics).</p><p>The site can specify the "freshness" of the authentication
ticket by requesting that the user have entered his or her sign-in
name and password within a site-specified time window. If the time
window has expired, the site will display the cobranded Passport
sign-in page and the user will be asked to reenter his or her
sign-in name and password before proceeding.</p><p>There is no direct server-to-server communication of users'
authentication and profile information between Passport and
participating sites. The information exchange occurs through the
client's browser using HTTP redirects and cookies. However, the
Passport Manager on the participating site's server does
periodically download a centrally hosted configuration file; this
is an XML document that contains current URLs for the Passport
servers and the current Passport profile configuration (or "profile
schema").</p><p>After signing in at one Passport participating site, a user can
sign in to others during the same Internet session simply by
clicking the Passport sign-in link on each site. The HTTP redirects
still occur, but Passport issues a set of encrypted cookies to
enable silent, seamless re-authentication across sites. (However,
participating sites do have the option of requiring the user to
reenter sign-in name and password regardless of the user's
authentication state, for added security.)</p><p>Users can also choose to be signed in automatically by saving
their Passport sign-in name and password on a given computer. This
option keeps a consumer signed in to Passport at all times on that
computer, even if the consumer disconnects from the Internet,
closes the browser, or turns off the computer.</p><p>When a user signs out by clicking the Passport sign-out scarab
on a participating site, all Passport cookies from all of the sites
visited during the browser session are deleted from the user's
computer. This is accomplished by means of HTML image tags and HTTP
redirects.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
