<h1>Remote Administration</h1>

If you are connecting to your server over the Internet or through a
proxy server, you can use a Web-based server management appliance
to change properties on your site. If you are on an <i>
intranet</i>, you can use either an appliance or the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> that is hosted in the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC). 

<p>Also, you can use <b><a name="ts">Microsoft Terminal
Services</a></b> over a network connection (such as LAN, PPTP, or
dial-up) to remotely administer an IIS Web server in which you are
an adminstrator. Terminal Services does not require you to install
the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> on the remote computer
because you use the IIS snap-in on the server that you are
connected to as if you are logged onto the server locally.</p><h6>To use Terminal Services for administering a remote site over a
network connection</h6><p>For more information, see either the server or client Terminal
Services documentation. By default, the Terminal Services
documentation is installed at C:\Winnt\Help\TermSrv.chm and
C:\Winnt\Help\TermCli.chm.</p><ol><li>Install the Terminal Services client on the computer you are
using to connect.</li><li>While the remote computer is running, launch Terminal Services
and identify the name of the remote computer.</li><li>From the Terminal Services window, you can administer IIS as
you would locally. You can launch the <a href="Javascript:gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> on any computer on your
network running Windows or launch a Web-based server management
appliance. Scripts can also be run from the Terminal Services
window.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Improving connection and administrative performance
may require disabling desktop services on the target computer such
as screen savers and Active Desktop.</p>
<h6>To use the IIS snap-in for administering a remote site on an
intranet</h6> <ol><li>Launch the <a href="Javascript:gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>
IIS snap-in</b></a> on any computer on your network running
Windows.</li><li>To connect to a remote IIS computer, click the <b>Computer</b>
icon on the toolbar and enter the name of the IIS computer (that
you wish to connect to) in the Computer Name field.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you do not have TCP/IP and a name resolution
server such as Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) installed, you
may not be able to connect to an IIS computer using the computer
name. As a alternative, you can use the IP address of the IIS
computer.</p>
<h6>To use a Web-based server management appliance for
administering a remote site over the internet</h6><p>Microsoft offers a Web-based server management appliance as a
replacement for the Internet Services Manager (HTML) also known as
HTMLA. The Microsoft Server Appliance Kit is available for free
from the Downloads page on MSDN. Other distributors, such as OEMs,
also offer server management appliances. Documentation usually
accompanies the appliance or kit.</p><h6>To access the online documentation locally or remotely</h6><ul><li>Start a browser and connect to
http://<i>servername</i>/iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp, where <i>
servername</i> is the computer running IIS.</li></ul><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li>For more information about browser-based administration, see <a href="wsa_webftp_aboutwebftp.htm#RemoteAdministration"><b>
