<h1>Edit-While-Running Scenario 6</h1><p>This scenario illustrates how edit-while-running works under the
following conditions:</p><ul><li>Two administrators edit the MetaBase.xml file at the same
time.</li></ul><p>What you will learn:</p><ul><li>Why allowing multiple users to simultaneously edit the
MetaBase.xml file in not recommended and not supported.</li></ul><p><b>Step 1:</b><br>
At the same time, two users open the MetaBase.xml file using
Notepad.</p><p><img src="MB_Scenario_EWR6step1.gif" alt="Describes step 1 of this scenario."></p><p><b>Step 2:</b><br>
User 1 changes the value of A (A=2) and saves MetaBase.xml.</p><p><img src="MB_Scenario_EWR6step2.gif" alt="Describes step 2 of this scenario."></p><ol><li>When User 1 saves MetaBase.xml, to determine the changes that
were made to MetaBase.xml, IIS checks the difference between the
new MetaBase.xml file and the history file of the same major
version number with the highest minor version number.</li><li>The changes are sent to the in-memory metabase through the
Admin Base Objects.</li><li>A new history file is created with the contents of the
corresponding history file and the changes that were sent to the
Admin Base Objects.</li></ol><p><b>Step 3:</b><br>
User 2 changes the value of C (C=2) and saves MetaBase.xml.</p><p><img src="MB_Scenario_EWR6step3.gif" alt="Describes step 3 of this scenario."></p><ol><li>When User 2 saves MetaBase.xml, to determine the changes that
were made to MetaBase.xml, IIS checks the difference between the
new MetaBase.xml file and the history file of the same major
version number with the highest minor version number.</li><li>The changes are sent to the in-memory metabase through the
Admin Base Objects.</li><li>A new history file is created with the contents of the
corresponding history file and the changes that were sent to
ABO.</li></ol><p>Because the two users open MetaBase.xml at the same time, the
corresponding history file should be
MetaBase_0000000008_0000000000.xml for both administrators. When
User 1 saves MetaBase.xml in step 2, IIS compares the MetaBase.xml
file that User 1 saves against the file with the highest minor
version number and the same major version number, which is
MetaBase_0000000008_0000000000.xml. In this case, the proper
history file is used to determine the changes that User 1 has made
to MetaBase.xml and a new history file,
MetaBase_0000000008_0000000001.xml, is created in the history
folder.</p><p>When User 2 saves MetaBase.xml, IIS compares MetaBase.xml
against the history file of the same major version number and
highest minor version number, MetaBase_000000008_0000000001.xml,
which is not the corresponding history file. Because User 2's
MetaBase.xml file is compared to the incorrect history file, User
1's edit (A=2) is overwritten with the previous value (A=1) because
IIS perceives that the value of A has changed.</p><div class="search-terms">phrase 1, phrase 2, phrase 3</div>
