<h1>Edit-While-Running Scenario 5</h1><p>This scenario illustrates how edit-while-running works under the
following conditions:</p><ul><li>An administrator programmatically deletes a site within the
in-memory metabase, and another administrator saves changes to the
same site by editing MetaBase.xml with Notepad.</li></ul><p>What you will learn:</p><ul><li>How edit-while-running allows an administrator to recover from
this situation by reporting an error.</li><li>Why allowing multiple administrators to simultaneously make
changes to the same site is not recommended.</li></ul><p><b>Actions Taken:</b></p><ul><li>Administrator 1 programmatically deletes Site4 in the in-memory
metabase.</li><li>Administrator 2 opens the MetaBase.xml file, changes a property
value under the Site4 node, and then saves the MetaBase.xml
file.</li></ul><ol><li>IIS receives a file change notification that the MetaBase.xml
file has been saved.</li><li>IIS looks within the MetaBase.xml file for the <b>
HistoryMajorVersionNumber</b> value.</li><li>IIS looks within the history folder for the corresponding
history file. The corresponding history file is the file with the
same <b>HistoryMajorVersionNumber</b> value as was found in step 2,
with the highest minor version number.</li><li>IIS verifies that the MetaBase.xml file can be parsed and is
free of schema errors.</li><li>IIS compares the MetaBase.xml file against the corresponding
history file to determine whether changes were made.</li><li>IIS verifies that the metabase level exists in the in-memory
metabase that the changes were made to. Because Site4 was deleted
from the in-memory metabase, an error is sent to the event
log.</li><li>IIS copies the MetaBase.xml file to the history folder and
renames the file in the following format:<br>       
MetaBase_<i>majorversion</i>_<i>minorversion</i>.xml</li><li>The in-memory metabase is written to disk to overwrite the non
valid MetaBase.xml file, and an error is sent to the event
log.</li></ol><div class="search-terms">phrase 1, phrase 2, phrase 3</div>
