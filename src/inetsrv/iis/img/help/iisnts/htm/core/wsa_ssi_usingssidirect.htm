<h1>Using Server-Side Include Directives</h1><p>You use server-side include (SSI) directives to instruct the Web
server to add text, graphic, or application content to a Web page
just before sending the page to the client's browser. SSI provides
special preprocessing directives that help you access information
about a file or display the value of a CGI variable. SSI also
provides a directive that you can use to insert the output from an
application or a shell command into a Web page.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>The #include statement is processed at compile
time, not at run time. Therefore, you cannot incorporate this
statement into the logic of your client-side procedures.</p>
<h2><a name="includingfiles">Including
Files</a></h2><p>To include a file, use the <a href="ref_ssi_include.htm"><b>#include</b></a> directive. For example, to insert a file named
Copyright.inc into a Web page when it is requested, use the
following directive in the Web page:</p><pre>
&lt;!-- #include file="Copyright.inc" --&gt;
</pre><p>In this example, the file Copyright.inc must be in the same
directory as the include file. The file that contains the <b>
#include</b> directive must be a published file in your Web site.
Included files do not require a special file name extension;
however, it is considered good programming practice to give
included files an .inc extension to distinguish them from other
types of files.</p><p>To locate the include file by specifying a path relative to the
current directory, use the <b>file</b> argument. For example, if
the calling file is in a directory named Documents and the include
file is in a subdirectory named Documents\Common, use the following
directive:</p><pre>
&lt;!-- #include file="Common\Copyright.inc" --&gt;
</pre><p>While you are working with documents in a Web site, you may want
to store shared files in a special virtual directory. To locate the
include file by specifying the full virtual path to the file, use
the <b>virtual</b> argument. For example, to include a file from
the /Common virtual directory, use the following directive:</p><pre>
&lt;!-- #include virtual="/Common/Copyright.inc" --&gt;
</pre><h2><a name="H2_37756964">Including Output from
Applications</a></h2><p>In addition to including the contents of a file, you can run an
application or a shell command by using an SSI directive and
include the output on your Web page. To run an application or a
shell command, use the <a href="ref_ssi_exec.htm"><b>#exec</b></a>
directive. The application can be a CGI program, an ASP
application, or an ISAPI extension. For example:</p><pre>
&lt;!-- #exec cgi=/scripts/guestbook.exe?FirstName+LastName&gt;
</pre><p>The path to the application must be a full virtual path, or URL.
You can pass parameters to the application by following the
application's file name with a question mark (?) and a list of
parameters joined by plus signs (+).</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Allowing ordinary Web files to run
applications presents a security risk. You can disable the <b>
#exec</b> directive and still allow Web pages to use the other SSI
directives.</p>
