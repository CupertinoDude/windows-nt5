<h1>Anonymous Authentication</h1><a name="H1_37675702"></a><p>Anonymous authentication gives users access to the public areas
of your Web or FTP site without prompting them for a user name or
password. When a user attempts to connect to your public Web or FTP
site, your Web server assigns the connection to the Windows user
account IUSR_<i>computername</i>, where <i>computername</i> is the
name of the server on which IIS is running. By default, the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account is included in the Windows user
group Guests. This group has security restrictions, imposed by NTFS
permissions, that designate the level of access and the type of
content available to public users.</p><p>If you have multiple sites on your server or if you have areas
of your site that require different access privileges, you can
create multiple anonymous accounts, one for each Web or FTP site,
directory, or file. By giving these accounts different access
permissions or by assigning these accounts to different Windows
user groups, you can grant users anonymous access to different
areas of your public Web and FTP content.</p><p>The following process explains how IIS uses the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account as follows:</p><ol><li>The IUSR_<i>computername</i> account is added to the Guests
group on the IIS computer during setup.</li><li>When a request is received, IIS impersonates the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account before executing any code or
accessing any files. IIS is able to impersonate the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account because the user name and password
for this account are known by IIS.</li><li>Before returning a page to the client, IIS checks NTFS file and
directory permissions to see whether the IUSR_<i>computername</i>
account is allowed access to the file.</li><li>If access is allowed, authentication completes and the
resources are available to the user.</li><li>If access is not allowed, IIS attempts to use another
authentication method. If none is selected, IIS returns an "HTTP
403 Access Denied" error message to the browser.</li></ol><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>If you enable Anonymous authentication, IIS
always attempts to authenticate the user with Anonymous
authentication first, even if you enable additional authentication
methods.</p>
<p>You can change the account that is used for Anonymous
authentication from the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>,
either at the Web server service level or for individual virtual
directories and files. The anonymous account must have the user
right to log on locally. If the account does not have the Log On
Locally permission, IIS will not be able to service any anonymous
requests. The IIS installation specifically grants the Log On
Locally permission to the IUSR_<i>computername</i> account. The
IUSR_<i>computername</i> accounts on domain controllers are not
given to guest accounts by default. To allow anonymous logons, you
must change IUSR_<i>computername</i> accounts to Log On
Locally.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>You can programmatically change the requirement for
Log On Locally rights by using the Active Directory Service
Interfaces (ADSI). For information, see <a href="ref_mb_logonmethod.htm"><b>LogonMethod</b></a>.</p>
<p>You can also change the security privileges for the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account in Windows by using the Group
Policy Manager snap-in of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
However, if the anonymous user account does not have permission to
access a specific file or resource, your Web server will refuse to
establish an anonymous connection for that resource. For more
information, see <a href="sec_acc_settwebperm.htm"><b>Setting Web Server Permissions</b></a>.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>When you change the IUSR_<i>computername</i>
account, the changes affect every anonymous HTTP request that a Web
server services. Use caution if you modify this account.</p>
<h2><a name="enableanon">Configuring Anonymous
Authentication</a></h2><p>By default, the Windows user group Guests includes the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account. You can create multiple anonymous
accounts; one for each Web or FTP site, directory, or file. By
giving these account different access permissions or by assigning
these accounts to different Windows user groups, you can grant
users anonymous access to different areas of your public Web and
FTP content.</p><p>The anonymous account must allow the user to log on locally. If
the account does not have the Log On Locally permission, IIS cannot
service anonymous requests. The IUSR_<i>computername</i> accounts
on domain controllers are not assigned this right by default and
must be changed to Log On Locally to allow anonymous requests.</p><p>You can also change the security privileges for the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account in Windows. However, if the
anonymous user account does not have permission to access a
specific resource, your Web server refuses to establish an
anonymous connection for that resource. For more information, see
