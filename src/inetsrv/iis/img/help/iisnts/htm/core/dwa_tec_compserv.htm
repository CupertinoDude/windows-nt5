<h1>Component Services</h1><p>New with Windows 2000, Component Services provides a number of
services that make component and Web application development
easier. These services include:</p><h5>Queued Components</h5><p>Queued Components allow you to create components that can
execute immediately if the client and server are connected. They
provide an easy way to invoke and execute components
asynchronously. In the event that the client and server are not
connected, the component can hold execution until a connection is
made. Queued Components assist the developer by using method calls
similar to those calls used in component development, thus
diminishing the need for an in-depth knowledge of marshaling. For
more information, see 

"Queued
Components" in the "Component Services" section of the Platform
SDK.</p><h5>Component Services Events</h5><p>Component Services Events lets publishers and subscribers
loosely connect to data souces so that these sources can be
developed, deployed, and executed separately. The publisher does
not need to know the number and location of the subscriber, and the
subscriber uses an intermediate broker to find a publisher and
manage the subscription to it. The event system simplifies
component and Web application development by allowing both
publisher and subscriber identities to be persistent: Publishers
and subscribers identities can be manipulated without being known
to each other.  For more information, see 

"COM+ Events" in the "Component Services" section of
the Platform SDK.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
