<h1>About Auditing</h1><p>You can use auditing techniques to monitor a broad range of
security-related activity. Auditing consists of creating auditing
polices for directory and file access or server events, and
monitoring the security logs to detect any access attempts by
unauthorized persons.</p><p>You can configure the security logs to record information about
either directory and file access, or server events, or both. These
are recorded in the Windows Security log. Also, the IIS logging
features can record events specific to IIS. By regularly reviewing
these files, you can detect areas of your server or your sites that
may be subject to attacks or other security problems. For more
information about reviewing these logs, see <a href="sec_audit_detecting.htm"><b>Detecting Unauthorized Access</b></a>.
For more information about IIS logging, see <a href="log_logging.htm"><b>Logging Site Activity</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="FileAccess">Auditing Directory or File
Access</a></h2><p>You can monitor access attempts, either successful or
unsuccessful, at the directory or file level. This includes events
such as reading the file, writing to the file, and browsing a
directory. You can choose which events you want to audit for any
file or directory. This level of auditing is set by using Windows
Explorer. For more information, see <a href="sec_audit_configmonitor.htm#auditset"><b>Configuring and
Monitoring Auditing</b></a>.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>

      </b></span>Your server's file system must be configured
to NTFS to use these auditing features. For information about
converting the file system, see the Windows documentation.</p>
<h2><a name="ServerEvents">Auditing Server
Events</a></h2><p>You can monitor server-wide events, such as logging on and off
the Web server, changing Web server security policies, and shutting
down the server computer. Events are audited for the entire
computer, rather than certain directories or files. This level of
auditing is set by using the Audit Polices in the Microsoft
Management Console. For more information, see <a href="sec_audit_configmonitor.htm#H1_37709189"><b>Configuring and
Monitoring Auditing</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="IISlogs">Auditing Web or FTP Site
Access</a></h2><p>You can monitor access attempts, either successful or
unsuccessful, to access your Web or FTP sites, virtual directories,
or files. This includes events such as reading the file or writing
to the file. You can choose which events you want to audit for any
site, virtual directory, or file. This level of auditing is set by
using the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>. For more
information, see <a href="log_logging.htm"><b>Logging Site Activity</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
