<h2>#config</h2><p>The <b>#config</b> directive specifies the string to be used for
SSI error messages, and the format to be used for dates and file
sizes returned by #flastmod, #fsize. You must surround a directive
with HTML comment delimiters.</p><p>By default, this directive can be used only in STM pages; it
cannot be used in ASP pages. To perform these tasks with ASP
script, you can use the <b>FileSystemObject</b> object which is
documented at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msdn&amp;pver=6.0&amp;ar=scripting" target="_New"><b>MSDN</b></a> under VBScript or JScript.</p><h6><b>Syntax</b></h6><p><b>&lt;!-- #config</b><i>Output</i><b>=</b><i>String</i><b>
--&gt;</b></p><h6><b>Parameters</b></h6><p><i>Output</i></p><p>Specifies the output to be formatted. The output can be one of
the following:</p><table width="" height=""><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Output</b></td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Meaning</b></td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">ERRMSG</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Overrides the message returned to the client browser when an
error occurs during the processing of an SSI directive. By default,
the error message provides debugging information that details
exactly what went wrong. To suppress these details, provide a
short, simple error message, such as "An SSI error has occurred."
The <i>String</i> parameter contains the new error message.</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">TIMEFMT</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Specifies the format in which dates should be returned to the
client browser with the #flastmod directive. The String parameter
specifies the format. You can extract individual portions of the
date, such as the day of the week or the month, by using formatting
tokens in String. (The formatting tokens are the same as those you
would use for the ANSI C strftime function). 

<p>The time and date functions below use the language set with the
C library locale rather than the operating system locale. The C
library locale is usually set to English.</p><p>%a   Abbreviated name for day of the week (for
example, Mon).</p><p>%A   Complete name for day of the week (for example,
Monday).</p><p>%b   Abbreviated month name (for example, Feb).</p><p>%B   Complete month name (for example, February).</p><p>%c   Date and time representation that is appropriate
for the C locale (for example, 05/06/01 12:51:32).</p><p>%d   Day of the month as a decimal number
(01–31)</p><p>%H   Hour in 24-hour format (00–23).</p><p>%I   Hour in 12-hour format (01–12).</p><p>%j   Day of the year as a decimal number
(001–366).</p><p>%m   Month as a decimal number (01–12).</p><p>%M   Minute as a decimal number (00–59).</p><p>%p   Current C locale's A.M. or P.M. indicator for
12-hour format (for example, PM).</p><p>%S   Second as a decimal number (00–59).</p><p>%U   Week of the year as a decimal number, with Sunday
as the first day of the week (00–51).</p><p>%w   Day of the week as a decimal number, with Sunday
as the first day (0–6).</p><p>%W   Week of the year as a decimal number, with Monday
as the first day of the week (00–51).</p><p>%x   Date representation for the current C locale (for
example, 05/06/01).</p><p>%X   Time representation for the current C locale (for
example, 12:51:32).</p><p>%y   Year without the century as a decimal number (for
example, 01).</p><p>%Y   Year with the century as a decimal number (for
example, 2001).</p><p>%z, %Z   Time-zone name or abbreviation; no characters
if time zone is unknown.</p><p>%%   Percent sign.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">SIZEFMT</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Configures the output of the #fsize directive to display the
file size in kilobytes or bytes. The String parameter can have one
of two values: "ABBREV" displays file size in kilobytes, and
"BYTES" displays file size in bytes.</td></tr></table><br><h6><b>Remarks</b></h6><p>The file containing this directive must use a file name
extension that is mapped to the SSI interpreter; otherwise, the Web
server will not process the directive. By default, the file name
extensions .stm, .shtm, and .shtml are mapped to the SSI
interpreter (ssinc.dll).</p><p>An STM page using the #echo directive must be run by itself, or
by calling it from an ASP page with Response.Redirect. Calling an
STM page from an ASP page with Server.Transfer, Server.Execute, or
#include will not work because that would force the STM page to go
through asp.dll instead of through ssinc.dll.</p><p>If you have the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>
installed, you can modify default extension mappings and add new
mappings; see <a href="ca_settappmappings.htm"><b>Setting Application Mappings</b></a>. Since you cannot map a file extension to more than
one executable, you cannot use this directive in ASP files. ASP
files are already mapped to the asp.dll and must stay that way.</p><h6><b>Example</b></h6><p>--- SSI.stm ---</p><pre>
&lt;!-- #config ERRMSG = "An error occurred processing a directive." --&gt;
</pre><pre>
SSI.stm was last formatted on 
&lt;!-- #config TIMEFMT = "%A, the %d of %B, %Y, at %H:%M" --&gt;
&lt;!-- #flastmod FILE = "ssi.stm" --&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;

The size of SSI.stm in bytes is
&lt;!-- #config SIZEFMT = "BYTES" --&gt;
&lt;!-- #fsize FILE = "ssi.stm" --&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

This line will print out the ERRMSG configured above&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;!-- #config SIZEFMT = "BYTE" --&gt;
