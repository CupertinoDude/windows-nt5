server.</li><li><b>Service Name</b> The Internet service that was running on
the client computer.</li><li><b>Server Name</b> The name of the server on which the log
entry was generated.</li><li><b>Server IP</b> The IP address of the server on which the log
entry was generated.</li><li><b>Server Port</b> The port number the client is connected
to.</li><li><b>Method</b> The action the client was trying to perform (for

terms.</li><li><b>Win32 Status</b> The status of the action, in terms used by
Windows.</li><li><b>Bytes Sent</b> The number of bytes sent by the server.</li><li><b>Bytes Received</b> The number of bytes received by the
server.</li><li><b>Time Taken</b> The length of time the action took.</li><li><b>Protocol Version</b> The protocol (HTTP, FTP) version used

either CGI or out-of-process application. The type can be CGI,
Application, or All.</li><li><b>Process Type</b> What event was triggered: Site-Stop,
Site-Start, Site-Pause, Periodic-Log, Interval-Start, Interval-End,
Interval-Change, Update, Eventlog-Limit, Priority-Limit,
Process-Stop-Limit, Site-Pause-Limit, Eventlog-Limit-Reset,
Priority-Limit-Reset, Process-Stop-Limit-Reset, or
Site-Pause-Limit.</li><li><ul><li><b>Site-Stop</b> The Web site was stopped.</li><li><b>Site-Start</b> The Web site was started or re-started.</li><li><b>Site-Pause</b> The Web site was paused.</li><li><b>Periodic-Log</b> This is a regularly defined log entry whose

and reset.</li><li><b>Reset Interval-Change</b> The Web site administrator changed
the value for the Reset Interval.</li><li><b>Update</b> One of these events happened: the log interval
was changed, and interval event took place, the site either stopped
started, or paused.</li><li><b>Eventlog-Limit</b> An event log was made for the Web site
because its CPU resource usage for CGI and out-of-process
application reached the event log limit set by the

application set to low priority because it reached the low priority
limit set by the administrator.</li><li><b>Process-Stop-Limit</b> The Web site had a CGI or
out-of-process application stopped because it reached the process

time, in seconds, that the site has used during the current
interval.</li><li><b>Page Faults</b> The total number of memory references that
resulted in memory page faults.</li><li><b>Total Processes</b> The total number of CGI and
out-of-process applications created during the current
interval.</li><li><b>Active Processes</b> The total number of CGI and

out-of-process applications stopped due to Process Throttling
