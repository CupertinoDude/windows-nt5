<h2>Variables</h2><h6>Overview</h6><p>Every application ever written, regardless of the programming
language, has used variables of some sort, and ASP scripts are no
exception. Both VBScript and JScript allow you to create and manage
variables simply and easily.</p><p>Each language deals with variable declaration differently. Both
JScript and VBScript are quite flexible about variables and their
declaration. In VBScript, any variable is automatically considered
to be of the <b>Variant</b> type when it is initially declared with
the <b>Dim</b> statement. Each variable eventually is assigned a
subtype, such as <b>Numeric</b> and <b>Array</b>. JScript is
similar; the variable is initially declared with the <b>var</b>
statement. Both languages, in general, try to perform much of the
data type management, including type conversion, automatically. In
fact, you don't even have to use the <b>Dim</b> or <b>var</b>
statements at all to use a new variable; they are optional in their
respective languages.</p><h6>Code Tour</h6><p>This sample declares several different kinds of variables,
performs simple operations on them, and then displays them to the
client browser using the special &lt;% = ...%&gt; script
delimiters. An integer is assigned to the variable <i>
intVariable</i>, added to itself, and the sum sent to the client
browser. <i>StrVariable</i> is set to equal to the first name, is
added to Smith, and sent to the client browser. Booleans and dates
are likewise declared or created, initialized, manipulated, and
displayed.</p><h6>Remarks</h6><p>Of particular interest is the final step in the date variable
demonstration. In VBScript, the variable is first assigned a
literal date string, and displayed. It is then reset, and assigned
the value that is returned by the VBScript <b>Now</b> function,
which returns the current system time. The JScript example uses the
JScript <b>Date</b> function to set both the initial literal by
passing parameters to the function, and then to set the variable
equal to the current system time by passing no parameters to the
function.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
