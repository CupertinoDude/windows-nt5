<h2>Orphaned Worker Processes</h2><p>In dedicated application mode, any worker process can be
configured to replace itself with another process. For example, if
a worker process fails to respond to a ping in a certain amount of
time, WAS marks that worker process as failing. Normally, WAS
terminates that worker process and starts a replacement. If the
Orphan Worker Process option is enabled, WAS leaves the failing
worker process running, and starts another process in its place.
This avoids service interruption of the requests coming in because
they are simply cached until the new process is ready to process
them.</p><p>Another benefit of placing worker processes in an orphaned state
is to aid in debugging. WAS can  be configured to run a
command on the process (like attaching a debugger) when the process
is placed in an orphaned state. With this feature, you can set up a
test application pool that will launch a debugger against a worker
process that fails to respond to a ping, thereby isolating it from
its replacement.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
