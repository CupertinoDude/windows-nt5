<h2>Functions and Procedures</h2><h6>Overview</h6><p>Functions and procedures provide a way to avoid rewriting the
same block of code every time you want to perform a particular
task. Both VBScript and JScript allow you to call a function or
procedure from any point in a script. This sample demonstrates how
you can create and use these tools with ASP.</p><p>If you don't have any functions in your ASP page, the ASP engine
simply processes your entire file, start to finish, each time it is
requested by a client browser. Functions and procedures, however,
are executed only when called, not inline with the rest of the
code.</p><p>You can denote functions and procedures in VBScript or JScript
by using the <b>Function</b> statement. In addition, VBScript makes
a distinction between a function that returns a value and a
function that does not; a function that returns a value is denoted
with the <b>Sub</b> statement, indicating that it is a
subroutine.</p><h6>Code Tour</h6><p>This sample defines one function, <b>PrintOutMsg</b>, which
takes as parameters a message, and a number that specifies how many
times the message is to be written to the client browser with the
<b>Response.Write</b> method. The function, for the purposes of
this sample, simply returns to the client browser the number of
times the message was printed.</p><h6>Remarks</h6><p>It is important to note the RUNAT attribute of the
&lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag. If the RUNAT attribute is not included, ASP
will assume that the script is client-side scripting, and will pass
the code back to the browser for processing. ASP would then not
recognize the <b>PrintOutMsg</b> function call, return an error,
and abort.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
