<h1>IIS Server Extensions</h1><p>Use this Internet Information Services property sheet to
configure IIS for performance, scripting, mail, and security using
FrontPage and Office Web Server server extensions.</p><h2><b>General Settings</b></h2><b><br>
Performance</b><p>Select the page range that's closest to the actual number of
pages in the selected web. The FrontPage Server Extensions will set
aside a certain amount of cache, based on the page range you
select. You can use custom settings to gain finer control over
performance, such as setting in-memory document cache, include file
cache, image file cache, full-text search index size, and maximum
cached document size.</p><b><br>
Client scripting</b><p>Click the scripting language, either JScript or VBScript, that
should be generated in pages automatically by the FrontPage Server
Extensions.</p><h2><b>Options</b></h2><p><b>Specify how mail should be sent</b></p><p>Displays the <b>E-mail Settings</b> dialog box, in which you can
specify how e-mail-based web features, such as e-mail form
handlers, send e-mail to Web site visitors. You can use the dialog
box to specify the Web server's e-mail address, contact e-mail
address, mail server, mail encoding scheme, and character set.</p><h2>Permissions</h2><b><br>
Configure Office collaboration features</b><p>Displays the Office Server Extensions administration web pages,
from which you can administer Office collaboration features, such
as workgroup discussions. This option is unavailable if the Office
Web Server (OWS) is not installed on your computer.</p><b><br>
Don't inherit security settings</b><p>By default, each root web inherits the global security settings
of the Web server. To override these settings for the selected root
web (and all of its subwebs) select this checkbox. Clear this check
box if you want the selected root web to inherit its security
settings from the global Web server settings</p><b><br>
Log authoring actions</b><p>Enables the system to record the time an author's action was
performed, the author's user name, the web name, the remote host,
and per-operation data, and store this information in a log file in
_vti_log/Author.log, in the root web. Clear this check box if you
do not want to log authoring actions.</p><b><br>
Manage permissions manually</b><p>Disables the security-setting functions of FrontPage Server
Extension administrative tools (such as the FrontPage MMC snap-in),
so that those tools cannot be used to modify the security settings
of the selected web. Clear this check box if you want to allow the
security settings to be changed by using the FrontPage Server
Extensions administrative tools.</p><b><br>
Require Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for authoring</b><p>Makes it possible for you to use SSL to authenticate prospective
web authors. This is recommended if you are currently using only
Basic Authentication, which only lightly encrypts information (such
as an author's user name and password) transmitted across the Web.
Clear this check box if you do not want to require SSL for
authoring.</p><b><br>
Allow authors to upload executables</b><p>Permits authors to upload CGI scripts or active server pages to
the selected web. Clear this check box if you want to prevent
executables from being uploaded to the web and avoid the risks
associated with a possibly buggy script or virus that's uploaded on
to your Web server.</p><p>For more information about Server Extensions, see the FrontPage
documentation.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
