<h1>Web Server Creator</h1><h6>Overview</h6><p>Server creation, deletion, stopping, starting, configuring:
These are all tasks that can keep you very busy, especially if you
are an administrator of a large Internet or intranet Web site. This
sample tool demonstrates how you can automate many of those
tasks.</p><h6>Code Tour</h6><p>This sample script provides a simple interface through which you
can create a new Web server. Several steps are required to
accomplish this, starting with invoking <b>GetObject</b> on the
IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC node. The <b>IIsWebService</b> object's ADSI
method <b>Create</b> is used to create a new <b>IIsWebServer</b>
object. The server object is then configured, and the new
information written back to the metabase with the <b>SetInfo</b>
method.</p><p>At this point in the script, the server is not a fully
functional Web site. It now has a node in the metabase, but it is
not running, nor does it have a root directory in which to store
anything. To finish creating the Web site, the tool creates an
instance of the <b>IIsWebVirtualDir</b> ADSI object, then
configures that object to be the new root directory for the new
server. <b>SetInfo</b> is once again called to save the information
to the metabase, and finally, if all has gone well up to this
point, the server object's <b>Start</b> method is invoked.</p><h6>Remarks</h6><p>Note that almost every major statement group in this sample has
its own set of error-code checking. This is important when creating
any tool in general, but especially for tools that use the IIS
metabase.</p><h6>Location</h6><p>This script is available in the Internet services directory, at
