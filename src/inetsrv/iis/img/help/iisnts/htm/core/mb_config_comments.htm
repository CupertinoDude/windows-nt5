<h1>Adding Metabase Comments</h1><p>Metabase XML comments must be stored in the in-memory metabase
and associated with nodes within the metabase, in order for the
context of the comments to be preserved during subsequent writes of
the metabase to disk. Comments are therefore associated with the
node that directly follows the comment. </p><p>When loading the metabase, the configuration system will load
comments as a generic property into the metabase along with other
metabase data.  In the case that comments are found at the
bottom of the file, below all nodes, that set of comments will
always be preserved at the bottom of the file.</p><p>Comments are added as follows:</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- your comment goes here --&gt;</code></pre><p>The following is a list of  rules concerning metabase
comments.</p><ul><li>Comments added above the MBProperty level are not picked up by
EWR.</li><li>Comments added between the MBProperty level and the IIS_Global
level cause an error file to be created.</li><li>Comments added between IIS_Global and IIS_ROOT are picked up by
EWR.</li><li>Adding comments between start and end XML tags result in an
error file and the in-memory metabase being flushed to disk.</li></ul><p>Currently files are written like this:</p><p>MetaBase.XML.0000000021.0000000000</p><p>and</p><p>MetaBase.XML.Error0000000005</p><div class="search-terms">phrase 1, phrase 2, phrase 3</div>
