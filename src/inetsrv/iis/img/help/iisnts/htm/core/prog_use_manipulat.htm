<h2>Manipulating the Metabase</h2><p>The IIS Admin Objects expose a hierarchical namespace of objects
where each object has an <b>ADsPath</b> property. The <b>
ADsPath</b> syntax is similar to that of a Uniform Resource Locator
(URL), in the form of IIS://[path], where [path] represents the
directory path of the object being accessed. For example,
IIS://MyComputer/W3SVC refers to the <b>IIsWebService</b> object
for the machine named MyComputer. The object associated with
MyComputer is the <b>IIsComputer</b> object, which contains all of
the other IIS Admin Objects.</p><p>To obtain a reference to a named object, you can use the <b>
GetObject</b> function in Visual Basic or VBScript.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Other scripting languages can be used; see the
documentation for the scripting language for details, as well as
the <a href="ref_prog_adsref.htm"><b>ADSI Reference</b></a>.</p>
<p>For example, you can retrieve the current value of <b>
ServerComment</b> by inserting the following VBScript into an .asp
file. In the following example, the string "LocalHost" is used
instead of the explicit name "MyComputer" to access the computer on
which IIS is running.</p><pre><code>&lt;% 
  Dim ComputerObj 
  Dim MaxBW 
  Set ComputerObj = GetObject("IIS://LocalHost") 
  MaxBW = ComputerObj.Get("MaxBandwidth") 
%&gt; 
</code></pre><p>This could also be implemented using the <i>object.property</i>
syntax, as in the following example.</p><pre><code>&lt;%
  Dim ComputerObj
  Dim MaxBW
  Set ComputerObj = GetObject("IIS://LocalHost")
  MaxBW = ComputerObj.MaxBandwidth
%&gt;
</code></pre><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>ASP pages that access the metabase require
administrator privileges on the computer on which IIS is running;
this is also true when running ASP applications out-of-process.
When you execute scripts from a remote computer, you must connect
through a secure connection, such as a connection protected by
integrated Windows authentication (also called NTLM
authentication). It is recommended that you create a server or
directory for your administrative .asp files and set the
authentication method to use Integrated Windows authentication for
the server or directory.</p>
<p>For security purposes, out-of-process applications cannot access
the metabase unless <b><a href="ref_mb_wamusername.htm"><b>WAMUserName</b></a></b> is recognized as an administrator. It is
recommended that you retain this default behavior unless special
circumstances require otherwise.</p><p>There are two ways you can modify this out-of-process behavior,
but each introduces some security risk:</p><ul><li>You can give the IWAM_<i>machinename</i> account anonymous or
NTLM access to the metabase, though this will allow access to the
metabase for all out-of-process applications created with this
default identity.</li><li>Or, you can change the identity of the specific out-of-process
package to some other account identity, and give only that account
administrator-level access to the metabase. This method introduces
less potential risk, but it must be implemented for each
out-of-process package.</li></ul><hr class="iis" size="1">
