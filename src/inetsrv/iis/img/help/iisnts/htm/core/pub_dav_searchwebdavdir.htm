<h1>Searching a WebDAV Directory</h1><p>After you create a WebDAV publishing directory, you may want to
allow users to search for content and file properties.</p><h6>To set up your publishing directory for searching</h6><br><ol><li>If you want to let clients search for resource properties, make
sure the directory is on a drive formatted for NTFS. 

<p>If you put the directory on a drive formatted for the file
allocation table (FAT) file system, clients can search for resource
content but cannot search for resource properties.</p></li><li>Make sure Indexing Service is running on your server by typing
the following at the command prompt: 

<p><code>net start cisvc</code></p></li><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, check the
<b>Virtual Directory</b> properties for your WebDAV directory to
make sure <b>Index this resource</b> and <b>Read</b> access options
are selected. 

<p>If <b>Index this resource</b> is not selected, Indexing Service
will not create a catalog for that directory, and therefore, no one
will be able to search it. If <b>Read</b> access has not been
selected, a client can search the directory, but will not be able
to see the results of the search. For details on setting IIS
permissions for a virtual directory, see Setting Web Server
Permissions.</p></li></ol><h2>Creating a Search Tool</h2><p>The Microsoft implementation of WebDAV allows you to create a
tool for clients to search a directory for content or properties or
both. The following example shows a basic search command from which
you can create a tool:</p><pre>
SEARCH /webdav HTTP/1.1
Host: iis
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 157

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;g:searchrequest xmlns:g="DAV:"&gt;
  &lt;g:sql&gt; Select "DAV:displayname"
                FROM SCOPE()
  &lt;/g:sql&gt;
&lt;/g:searchrequest&gt;

</pre><p>For details about creating a search tool, see the Microsoft®
Platform SDK.</p><h2>Searching for Properties</h2><p>There are two kinds of properties: server defined and user
defined.</p><p><b>Server-defined properties</b> include all properties created
and maintained by the server. These properties are Read-only, and
therefore, cannot be modified. Examples include the date a document
was created and when it was last modified.</p><p><b>User-defined properties</b> include all properties that can
be created and modified by a user. Examples include the author of a
document and the document's title. If you want clients to be able
to find documents based on a user-defined property, you must create
the property or make sure that it already exists.</p><p>Along with existing properties that users can define and modify,
you can create your own <b>custom properties</b>. This means you
could create a custom property called <b>Source</b>, which names
any resource consulted in developing a document. A user could then
search a site for all documents developed from a certain source.
The following example shows a property which names resources at the
Library of Congress.</p><pre>
where contains ("Source", "Library of Congress")

</pre><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Currently, WebDAV only supports searching for
custom properties that are strings.</p>
