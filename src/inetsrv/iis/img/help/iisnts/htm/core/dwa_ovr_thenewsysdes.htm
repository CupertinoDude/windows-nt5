<h1>The New System Design</h1><p>Today's client/server applications resemble their ancestors so
little that they have been given a new name, the <i>multitier
application</i>, also known as <i>n-tier</i> architecture. In this
model, processing is distributed between the client and the server,
and business logic is captured in a middle tier. Most systems will
perform the following three main tasks, which correspond to three
tiers, or layers, of the <i>n</i>-tier model:</p><table width="" height=""><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Task</b></td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">User interface and navigation</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Labeled Tier 1 in the following graphic, this layer comprises
the entire user experience. Not only does this layer provide a
graphical interface so that users can interact with the
application, input data, and view the results of requests, it also
manages the manipulation and formatting of data once the client
receives it. In Web applications, the browser performs the tasks of
this layer.</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Business logic</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tier 2, between the interface and data services layers, is the
domain of the distributed application developer. Business logic,
which captures the rules that govern application processing,
connects the user at one end with the data at the other. The
functions that the rules govern closely mimic everyday business
tasks, and can be a single task or a series of tasks.</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Data services</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Shown as Tier 3 in the following graphic, data services are
provided by a structured (SQL, Oracle database) or unstructured
(Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange, Microsoft<sup>®</sup>
Message Queuing) data store, which manages and provides access to
the application data. A single application may enlist the services
of one or more data stores.</td></tr></table><br><p>The three-tier architecture isolates each major piece of
functionality, so that the presentation is independent of the
processing rules and business logic, which in turn is separate from
the data. This model requires much more analysis and design up
front, but greatly reduces maintenance costs and increases
functional flexibility in the long run. The following diagram
depicts the Microsoft technologies that service the various tiers
in the new system design.</p><p><img src="3tier.gif" alt="3-Tier Architecture"></p><div class="search-terms">(The following words are used by Search;
