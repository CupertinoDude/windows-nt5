<h1>Certificate Authentication</h1><p>You can use your Web server's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
security feature for two types of authentication. You can use a <i>
server certificate</i> to allow users to authenticate your Web site
before they transmit personal information, such as a credit card
number. Also, you can use <i>client certificates</i> to
authenticate users requesting information on your Web site. SSL
authenticates by checking the contents of an encrypted digital
identification submitted by the user's Web browser during the logon
process. (Users obtain client certificates from a mutually trusted
third-party organization.) Server certificates usually contain
information about your company and the organization that issued the
certificate. Client certificates usually contain identifying
information about the user and the organization that issued the
certificate. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_certificate.htm"><b>Certificates</b></a>.</p><h3><a name="H4_37683048">Client Certificate
Mapping</a></h3><p>Because a Windows user account is required to access resources
like files, you can map, client certificates to Windows user
accounts on your Web server. After you create and enable a
certificate map, each time a user logs on with a client
certificate, your Web server automatically associates that user to
the appropriate Windows user account. This way, you can
automatically authenticate users who log on with client
certificates, without requiring the use of other supported
authentication methods such as Basic, Digest, or Integrated Windows
authentication. You can map either one client certificate to one
Windows user account or many client certificates to one account.
For example, if you had several different departments or businesses
on your server, each with its own Web site, you could use
many-to-one mapping to map all of the client certificates of each
department or company to its own Web site. This way, each site
provides access only to its own clients. For more information, see
<a href="sec_auth_mapclient.htm"><b>Mapping Client Certificates to User Accounts</b></a>.</p><div class="search-terms">phrase 1, phrase 2, phrase 3</div>
