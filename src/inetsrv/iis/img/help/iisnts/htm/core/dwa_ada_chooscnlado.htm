<h2>Choosing the Client Networking Library for ADO</h2><p>When ADO communicates with a database it does so through a
networking library. Your selection of a networking library will be
determined by the data provider and system configuration, and can
have a significant impact on database access speed. For example, if
you are accessing data from a Microsoft SQL Server database your
access speed, in general, will be faster if you use the TCP/IP
networking library. However, if SQL Server is running on the same
computer as IIS, you may find some performance improvements by
using the Named Pipes networking library.</p><p>You can set the networking library for a DSN by using the <b>
Data Sources (ODBC)</b> option in Control Panel. Once you set a
library for one connection, it will become the default library for
all subsequent connections, as well as for any DSN-less connections
that your application may use.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you change the network library from Named Pipes
to TCP/IP, be sure not to remove Named Pipes as one of the options,
because SQL Server Enterprise Manager relies on this library.</p>
