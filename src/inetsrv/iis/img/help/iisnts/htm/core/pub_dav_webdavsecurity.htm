<h1>Managing WebDAV Security</h1><a name="ManagingWebDAVSecurity"></a><p>This section describes the recommended best practices to set up
secure remote publishing. You will learn how to protect your server
and content by coordinating different aspects of security into an
integrated whole. These aspects of security include:</p><ul><li><a href="#Authenticating"><b>Authenticating Clients</b></a></li><li><a href="#ControllingAccess"><b>Controlling Access</b></a></li><li><a href="#FileSize"><b>Denying Service</b></a></li></ul><h2><a name="Authenticating"></a>Authenticating
Clients</h2><p>IIS offers the following levels of authentication:</p><ul><li>Anonymous</li><li>Basic</li><li>Integrated Windows</li><li>Digest</li><li>Advanced Digest</li></ul><p>The best way to configure a WebDAV directory depends on the kind
of publishing you want to do. When you create a virtual directory
through IIS, Anonymous and Integrated Windows authentication are
both turned on. Although this default configuration works well for
clients connecting to your server, reading content on a Web page,
and running scripts, it does not work well with clients publishing
to a directory and manipulating files in that directory.</p><p><b>Anonymous access</b> grants anyone access to the directory,
and therefore, you should turn it off for a WebDAV directory.
Without controlling who has access, your directory could be
vandalized by unknown clients. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#Anonymous"><b>Anonymous
Authentication</b></a>.</p><p><b>Basic authentication</b> sends passwords over the connection
in clear text. Because clear text can easily be intercepted and
read, you should turn on Basic authentication only if you encrypt
passwords through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). For more information,
see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#basic"><b>Basic Authentication</b></a>
and <a href="sec_auth_certsetssl.htm"><b>Setting Up SSL on Your Server</b></a>.</p><p><b>Digest authentication</b> is a good choice for publishing
information on a server that is accessed over the Internet and
through firewalls because the passwords are sent over the network
as an MD5 hash. However, passwords are stored as plain text in
Active Directory. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#digest"><b>Digest Authentication</b></a>.</p><p><b>Advanced Digest authentication</b> is an improvement over
digest authentication because in addition to sending passwords over
the network as an MD5 hash, the passwords are also stored in Active
Directory as an MD5 hash rather than plain text. This makes
Advanced Digest the best choice for publishing information on a
server that is accessed over the Internet and through firewalls.
For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#advanceddigest"><b>Advanced Digest
Authentication</b></a>.</p><p><b>Integrated Windows authentication</b> works best when you are
setting up a WebDAV directory on an intranet. For more information,
see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#challenge"><b>Integrated Windows
Authentication</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="ControllingAccess">Controlling
Access</a></h2><p>This section describes how you can control access to your WebDAV
directory by coordinating IIS and Windows Whistler permissions, and
how you can protect your script files.</p><h3><a name="Permissions">Configuring Web
Permissions</a></h3><p>This section recommends various ways to configure Web
permissions based on the purpose of the material you are
publishing.</p><ul><li><b>Read, Write, Directory browsing
enabled</b>   Turning on these permissions lets
clients see a list of resources, modify them (except for those
resources without Write permission), publish their own resources,
and manipulate files.</li><li><b>Write enabled; and Read and Directory browsing
disabled</b>   If you want clients to publish
private information on the directory, but do not want others to see
what has been published, set Write permission and do not set Read
or Directory browsing permission. This configuration works well if
clients are submitting ballots or performance reviews.</li><li><b>Read and Write enabled; and Directory browsing
disabled</b>   Set this configuration if you want to
rely on obscuring file names as a security method. However, be
aware that security by obscurity is a low-level security precaution
because a vandal could guess file names by trial and error.</li><li><b>Index this resource enabled</b>   Be sure to
enable Indexing Service if you plan to let clients search directory
resources.</li></ul><p>For more information about Web permissions, see <a href="sec_acc_settwebperm.htm"><b>Setting Web Server Permissions</b></a>.</p><h3><a name="ACLs">Controlling Access with DACLs</a></h3><p>When setting up a WebDAV publishing directory on an NTFS file
system drive, Windows Whistler Server gives everyone Full
Control by default except in the Wwwroot directory. Change this
level of permission so that the Everyone group has Read permission
<i>only</i>. Then grant Write permission to certain individuals or
groups.</p><p>For more information about NTFS permissions, see <a href="sec_acc_aboutacc.htm#NTFSpermissions"><b>NTFS
Permissions</b></a>.</p><h3><a name="Script">Protecting Script Code</a></h3><p>If you have script files in your publishing directory that you
do not want to expose to clients, you can deny access to these
files by verifying that <b>Script source access</b> is not granted.
Scripts include files with extensions that appear in the
Applications Mapping list. All other executable files are treated
as static HTML files, including files with .exe extensions, unless
<b>Scripts and Executables</b> is enabled for the directory.</p><p>To prevent .exe files from being downloaded and viewed as HTML
files, but to allow them to be run, on the <b>Virtual Directory</b>
property sheet of the publishing directory, change the Execute
Permissions to <b>Scripts and Executables</b>. This level of
permission makes all executable files subject to the <b>Script
source access</b> setting. With <b>Script source access</b> is
selected, clients with Read permission can see all executables, and
clients with Write permission can edit them, as well as run
them.</p><p>With the following permissions, clients can write to an
executable file that does not appear in the Application
Mapping:</p><ul><li>Write permission is granted.</li><li>Execute Permissions is set to <b>Scripts only</b>.</li></ul><p>With the following permissions, clients can also write to an
executable file:</p><ul><li><b>Script source access</b> is granted.</li><li>Execute Permissions is set to <b>Scripts and
Executables</b>.</li></ul><h2><a name="FileSize">Denying Service</a></h2><p>Dragging and dropping extremely large files into a WebDAV
directory could take up a large amount of disk space. To limit this
amount, you can set a quota on disk usage. To learn more about disk
quotas, see "Disk Quotas Overview" in the Windows
Whistler Server documentation.</p><p>For more information about security, see <a href="sec_checklist.htm"><b>IIS Security Checklist</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
