<h1>About Web and FTP Sites</h1><a name="H1_37761870"></a><p>This topic contains conceptual information about Web sites and
FTP sites (virtual servers). This topic describes the properties of
Web and FTP sites, administration privileges, and administration
from remote locations. This section includes:</p><ul><li><a href="#virtualservers"><b>Web and FTP Sites</b></a></li><li><a href="#propertiesandinheritanceofpropertiesonvirtualservers"><b>

Sites</a></h2><p>There are three ways to create multiple Web and FTP sites on a
single computer. This is true for an intranet or the Internet.
However, you must be running Windows Whistler:</p><ul><li>Append port numbers to the IP address.</li><li>Assign multiple IP addresses to one or multiple network adapter
cards.</li><li>Assign multiple domain names and IP addresses to one network
adapter card by using host header names.</li></ul><p>For more information about hosting multiple sites, see <a href="wsa_res_aboutnameres.htm#AssigningNamestoVirtualServers"><b>
Assigning Host Header Names, Addresses, and Ports to Web Sites</b></a>
in About Name Resolution.</p><p>The following example illustrates an intranet scenario where the
system administrator has installed Whistler server with IIS on
the company's server, resulting in one default Web site,
http://CompanyServer. The system administrator then creates two <i>
additional</i> Web sites for two separate departments: Marketing
and Human Resources.</p><img src="iivsovr1.gif" alt="A computer hosting three Web sites on an intranet."><p>Though hosted on the same computer, <i>CompanyServer</i>, <i>
Marketing</i>, and <i>HumanResources</i> each appear to be a unique
Web site. These departmental sites have the same security options
they would have if these sites existed on separate computers
because each site has its own access and administration permission
settings. In addition, the administrative tasks can be distributed
to members of each department.</p><p>When creating a very large number of sites, be sure to consider
hardware limitations and upgrade your hardware as necessary. For
more information, refer to the <i>IIS Resource Guide</i> volume of
the Windows Whistler Resource Kit.</p><h2><a name="propertiesandinheritanceofpropertiesonvirtualservers">
Properties and Inheritance of Properties on Sites</a></h2><p>Properties are values that can be set on your Web site. For
example, you can use the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>
to change the TCP port assigned to the default Web site from the
default value of 80 to another port number. Properties for a site
are displayed in property sheets and stored in a database called
the <i>metabase</i>.</p><p>During IIS installation, default values are assigned to the
various properties that are found on the property sheets. You can
use the default settings in IIS or you can customize these settings
to suit your Web publishing needs. You may be able to provide
additional value, better performance, and improved security by
making adjustments to the default settings.</p><p>Properties can be set on the site level, on the directory level,
or on the file level. Settings on higher levels (such as the site
level) are automatically used, or <i>inherited</i>, by the lower
levels (such as the directory level) but can still be edited
individually at the lower level as well. Once a property has been
changed on an individual site, directory, or file, later changes to
the master defaults do not automatically override the individual
setting. Instead, you receive a warning message that asks whether
you want to change the individual site, directory, or file setting
to match the new defaults.</p><p>Some properties have a value that takes the form of a list. For
instance, the value of the default document can be a list of
documents that are loaded when users do not specify a file in a
URL. Custom error messages, TCP/IP access control, script mappings,
and MIME mappings are other examples of properties stored in a list
format. Although these lists have multiple entries, IIS treats the
entire list as a single property. If you edit a list on a directory
and then make a global change on the site level, the list at the
directory level is completely replaced with the new list from the
site level; the lists are not merged. Also, properties with list
values display their lists only at the master level, or on a site
or directory that has been changed from the default value. List
values are not displayed if they are the inherited defaults.</p><p><a href="ca_installingisapi.htm"><b>Installing ISAPI Filters</b></a> are displayed in a
list format but are not treated as a list. If you add filters at
the site level, the new filters are merged with the list of filters
from the master level. If two filters have the same priority
setting, the filter from the master level is loaded before the
filter from the site level.</p><p>If the default property values need to be modified and you are
creating several Web or FTP sites, you can edit the default values
so that each site you create inherits your custom values. For more
information on changing the default values for all Web sites or all
FTP sites, see <a href="wsa_changeinherited.htm"><b>Changing the Inherited Defaults</b></a>.</p><p>The following graphic depicts the property sheets used to set
all Web site properties.</p><img src="iivsovr3.gif" alt="The Web site property sheets"><p>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, you can click
the <b>Help</b> button on a property sheet to learn more about
individual property settings.</p><h2><a name="websiteoperators">Web Site
Operators</a></h2><p>Web site Operators are a special group of users who have limited
administrative privileges on individual Web sites. Operators can
administer properties that affect only their respective sites. They
do not have access to properties that affect IIS, the Windows
server computer hosting IIS, or the network.</p><p>For example, an ISP who hosts sites for a number of different
companies can assign delegates as the Operators for each company's
Web site. This method of distributed server administration has the
following advantages:</p><ul><li>Each Operator can act as the site administrator and can change
or reconfigure the Web site as necessary. For example, the Operator
can set Web site access permissions, enable logging, change the
default document or footer, set content expiration, and enable
content ratings features.</li><li>The Web site Operator is not permitted to change the
identification of Web sites, configure the anonymous user name or
password, throttle bandwidth, create virtual directories or change
their paths, or change application isolation.</li><li>Because Operators have more limited privileges than Web site
administrators, they are unable to remotely browse the file system
and, therefore, cannot set properties on directories and files,
unless a UNC path is used.</li></ul><p>For instructions on how to designate Windows user accounts as
Web site Operators, see <a href="wsa_assignwso.htm"><b>Assigning Web Site Operators</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="RemoteAdministration">
Administering Sites Remotely</a></h2><p>Because it may not always be convenient to perform
administration tasks on the computer running IIS, three remote
administration options are available. If you are connecting to your
server over the Internet or through a proxy server, you can use a
Web-based server management appliance to change properties on your
site. The Microsoft Server Appliance Kit is available from the
MSDN, but otherr distributors, such as OEMs, also offer server
management appliances. If you are on an <i>intranet</i>, you can
use either an appliance or the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> that is hosted in the Microsoft Management Console
(MMC).</p><p>Also, you can use <b><a name="ts">Microsoft Terminal
Services</a></b> over a network connection (such as LAN, PPTP, or
dial-up) to remotely administer IIS. Terminal Services does not
require you to install the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or
the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> on the remote
computer. For more information, see the Terminal Services
documentation. By default, the Terminal Services documentation is
installed at C:\Winnt\Help\TermSrv.chm and
C:\Winnt\Help\TermCli.chm.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>In previous releases the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> was called the Internet
Service Manager.</p>
<p>The online documentation is also available when performing
remote administration tasks. To reach the documentation, start a
browser and type <b>
http://<i>servername</i>/iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp</b>, where
<i>servername</i> is the name of the computer running IIS.</p><h2><a name="ftpresume">FTP Restart</a></h2><p>FTP restart addresses the problem of losing a network connection
while downloading files. Clients that support FTP restart need only
re-establish their FTP connection using the REST command and the
file transfer will automatically pick up where it left off.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>The IIS 5.1 implementation of FTP restart is
not enabled when using FTP to download wildcard requests (MGET),
uploading files to a server (PUT), or downloading files larger than
4 gigabytes.</p>
<h2><a name="mimemap">MIME Map</a></h2><p>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an Internet
standard that provides a way for Web browsers to view files that
are in multiple formats. The registered file types that are
installed by default on Windows Whistler are listed in the <b>File
Types</b> dialog box of the <a href="sa_ui_iisps.htm"><b>Internet Information Services Property Sheet</b></a>.</p><p>MIME mappings can be configured at the computer, Web site,
virtual directory, directory, or file level. To configure MIME
mappings at the computer level, use the <a href="sa_ui_iisps.htm"><b>Internet Information Services Property Sheet</b></a>. To configure MIME
mappings at the other levels, use the <a href="sa_ui_httpheadersps.htm"><b>HTTP Headers Property Sheet</b></a> property sheet.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>MIME mappings configured at the computer level do
not automatically override those set at the lower levels.</p>
