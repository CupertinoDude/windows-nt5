<h1>Edit-While-Running Scenario 4</h1><p>This scenario illustrates how edit-while-running works under the
following conditions:</p><ul><li>MetaBase.XML is newer than the temporary file when the
in-memory metabase is written to disk.</li><li>Edit-while-running is enabled.</li></ul><p>What you will learn:</p><ul><li>How edit-while-running handles the situation when the in-memory
metabase is written to disk and the MetaBase.XML file, which has
pending changes, is newer than the temporary file.</li></ul><p><b>Step 1:</b><br>
Edit the value of C (C=2) in the in-memory metabase.</p><p><img src="MB_Scenario_EWR4step1.gif" alt="Describes step 1 of this scenario."></p><p><b>Step 2:</b><br>
Using a text editor, open MetaBase.XML, change C (C=1), and then
save and close the file.</p><p>This step outlines what happens when the in-memory metabase is
written to disk at approximately the same time that changes are
saved to MetaBase.XML by using a text editor such as Notepad. A
race-against-time between the temporary file overwriting
MetaBase.XML and MetaBase.XML being saved by Notepad
begins. </p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>For the purpose of this scenario, the
MetaBase.XML file saved by using Notepad is newer (has a later
timestamp) than the temporary file that was created when the
in-memory metabase was written to disk.</p><p><img src="MB_Scenario_EWR4step2.gif" alt="Describes step 2 of this scenario."></p><ol><li>When the in-memory metabase is written to disk, IIS creates a
temporary file with the contents of the in-memory metabase.</li><li>The temporary file is copied to the history folder and renamed
in the following format, where <i>MajorVersionNumber</i> is the
numerical value that is assigned to the <b>
HistoryMajorVersionNumber</b> property written within the temporary
file: 

<p>
MetaBase_<i>MajorVersionNumber</i>_<i>MinorVersionNumber</i>.XML</p><p>The minor version number is reset to zero. In this scenario, the
temporary file is renamed to
MetaBase_0000000008_0000000000.XML.<br> </p></li><li>An instant later, the MetaBase.XML file is saved using
Notepad.</li><li>IIS compares the date and timestamps of the temporary file and
MetaBase.XML. 

<p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Because the MetaBase.XML file is newer than
the temporary file, IIS does not overwrite MetaBase.XML with the
temporary file. Instead, an error is sent to the event
log.</p></li><li>IIS compares the difference between MetaBase.XML and the
corresponding history file and sends the changes to the in-memory
metabase through the Admin Base Objects.</li><li>In the history folder, a new file is created, named
MetaBase_0000000007_0000000001.XML, that has the contents of the
corresponding history file and the changes that were sent to the
in-memory metabase.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>The value that was changed by directly
editing the in-memory metabase (C=2) in step 1 was overwritten by
the administrator who changed the value (C=1) in MetaBase.XML using
Notepad. This is because the last write always wins.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Because the last write always wins, you
should not run a script that makes API changes to the in-memory
metabase and edits MetaBase.XML at the same time.</p><div class="search-terms">phrase 1, phrase 2, phrase 3</div>
