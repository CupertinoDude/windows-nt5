<h1>Performance and Scalability Testing</h1><p>Careful planning and development are necessary for any Web
application development project. However, in order to make a truly
scalable Web application, it is important that you rigorously and
regularly test it for scalability problems. You should remember
that almost all Web applications encounter some unforeseen
scalability problems during development. The only way these
problems can be found and solved is through careful, thorough
testing.</p><p>In general, the most useful scalability and performance testing
stresses the application in a way that closely parallels the actual
stresses the application would undergo in a "real-world"
setting.</p><p><b>Microsoft</b><sup>®</sup><b>Web Application Stress
Tool</b> is a Web stress tool that is designed to realistically
simulate multiple browsers requesting pages from a Web application.
It can be used to generate customizable loads on various Internet
services, and offers a rich set of features, that are desirable for
anyone interested in gathering performance data for a particular
Web site.</p><p>The <b>Web Application Stress Tool</b> is available on the
Windows 2000 Resource Kit Companion CD.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
