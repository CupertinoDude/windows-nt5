<h2>#include</h2><p>The <b>#include</b> directive instructs the Web server to insert
the contents of a file into a Web page. You must surround a
directive with HTML comment delimiters.</p><p>This directive can be used in an ASP page, STM page, INC page,
or any page with a file name extension that is mapped to the SSI
interpreter (ssinc.dll) or to the ASP interpreter (asp.dll). If you
have Internet Service Manager installed, you can modify default
extension mappings and add new mappings; see <b>Setting Application
Mappings</b>.</p><p>Included files can have any file name extension, but a
recommended practice is to give them the .inc extension. Included
files will go through the interpreter of the calling page. For
example, if you want to include a page that uses the #exec
directive, you must call it from an STM page. If you want to
include a page with ASP script, you must call it from an ASP page.
Included HTM pages will work as expected.</p><h6>Syntax</h6><p><b>&lt;!-- #include</b><i>PathType</i><b>=</b><i>FileName</i><b>--&gt;</b></p><h6>Parameters</h6><p><i>PathType</i></p><p>Specifies the type of the path to <i>FileName</i>. The path type
can be one of the following:</p><table width="" height=""><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Path Type</b></td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Meaning</b></td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">File</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">The <i>FileName</i> is a relative path from the directory
containing the document with the <b>#include</b> directive. The
included file can be in the same directory or in a subdirectory.
The included file cannot be in a directory above the page with the
<b>#include</b> directive unless you have checked the box for
Enable Parent Paths in the property sheet for the web folder. This
is discouraged because it is a security risk. Any web user could
type ../.. as a part of a URL for your site and be shown the
contents of parent folders you may not want them to see.</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Virtual</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">The file name is a full virtual path from a virtual directory
in your Web site.</td></tr></table><br><p><i>FileName</i></p><p>Specifies the name of the file to be included. <i>FileName</i>
must contain the file name extension, and you must enclose the file
name in quotation marks (").</p><h6><b>Remarks</b></h6><p>The file containing this directive must use a file name
extension that is mapped to the SSI interpreter; otherwise, the Web
server will not process the directive. By default, the file name
extensions .stm, .shtm, and .shtml are mapped to the SSI
interpreter (ssinc.dll).</p><p>An STM page using the #echo directive must be run by itself, or
by calling it from an ASP page with Response.Redirect. Calling an
STM page from an ASP page with Server.Transfer, Server.Execute, or
#include will not work because that would force the STM page to go
through asp.dll instead of through ssinc.dll.</p><p>If you have the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>
installed, you can modify default extension mappings and add new
mappings; see <a href="ca_settappmappings.htm"><b>Setting Application Mappings</b></a>. Since you cannot map a file extension to more than
one executable, you cannot use this directive in ASP files. ASP
files are already mapped to the asp.dll and must stay that way.</p><h6><b>Example</b></h6><p>--- IncExample.asp ---</p><pre>
&lt;!-- The included file is in the same directory as IncExample.asp. --&gt;
&lt;!-- #include file = "myfile.inc" --&gt;

&lt;!-- The included file is in the directory above IncExample.asp.
     Enable Parent Paths must be checked for the web folder. --&gt;
&lt;!-- #include file = "..\myfile.htm" --&gt;

&lt;!-- The included file is in the Scripts virtual directory. --&gt;
&lt;!-- #include virtual = "/scripts/tools/global.inc" --&gt;
