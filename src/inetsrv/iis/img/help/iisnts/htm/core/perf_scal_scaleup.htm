<h1>Scaling Up</h1><p>Scaling up means adding resources like RAM or CPUs to a Web
server to increase the number of sites that server can publish.
Scaling up can be an inexpensive way to scale and boost
performance, especially if you host static-content Web sites. For
example, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that wants to scale up
can take an existing server that currently houses 5,000 Web pages
and by adding more RAM and CPUs may boost that level to 8,000 Web
pages. The impact to the budget and resources is limited to adding
pieces of hardware, in comparison to adding servers, software
licenses, and more administrators to help manage more
servers. </p><p>One of the primary benefits of scaling up pertains to finding
and fixing errors. If performance issues arise, problems are
typically easier to locate when scaling up because the number of
servers and connections to backend servers has not grown. </p><p>Performance results when scaling up are typically not as good as
<a href="perf_scal_scaleout.htm"><b>Scaling Out</b></a>. See <a href="perf_scal_aboutscal.htm"><b>About Scalability</b></a> for a quick
summary of the benefits and drawbacks of scaling up versus other
methods of scaling. Adding more resources to a server can increase
performance, but requests coming into the server have to share
resources, which means that performance will not double because you
doubled the amount of RAM in a server. Shared resources can result
in lock contention, which is a much bigger issue when scaling up
than <a href="perf_scal_scaleout.htm"><b>Scaling Out</b></a>.</p><p>Test your server before adding hardware. Use <a href="perf_mon_tools.htm"><b>Tools Used to Monitor Performance</b></a> to
establish a baseline for your system's performance and scalability.
After installing the new hardware, test the system again to see if
the results are positive. If the results are not positive or not as
good as you want, see the <a href="perf_scal_scaltesting.htm"><b>Scalability Testing</b></a> and <a href="perf_net_aboutcapacity.htm"><b>About Network Capacity Planning</b></a> topics for tips on improving results.</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_New"><b>Microsoft.com</b></a> currently houses
information on the Scalable Hosting Solution, an IIS virtual
hosting ISAPI filter sample application. The Scalable Hosting
Solution (SHS) sample application enhances the ability of IIS to
host thousands of static-content sites using an ISAPI filter that
provides an alternate approach to configuring individual sites in
the metabase. Search for SHS on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_New"><b>www.microsoft.com</b></a> and select
