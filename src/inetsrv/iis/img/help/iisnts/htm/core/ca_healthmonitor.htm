<h2>Health Monitoring</h2><p>The Web Administration Service is capable of monitoring the
health of worker processes by pinging the worker processes
periodically to determine if they are unresponsive. If worker
processes fail to respond to a ping, the WAS terminates the worker
process and creates another worker process as a replacement. The
WAS also maintains a communication channel to each worker process
and can detect a drop in the communication channel indicating a
worker process failure. When a worker process fails on its own
accord, the WAS starts another process in its place.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
