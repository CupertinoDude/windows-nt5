<h1>About Security</h1><a name="H1_37678347"></a><p>This topic includes overviews of the five main security elements
that Internet Information Services 5.1 provides: authentication,
access control, encryption, auditing, and certificates. This
section also includes information about how to configure security
for your Web server, an introduction to the new task wizards in
IIS, and comments on the standards supported by IIS security. The
following topics are included:</p><ul><li><a href="#wizards"><b>The New Task Wizards</b></a></li><li><a href="#authenticationbasics"><b>Authentication</b></a></li><li><a href="#accesscontrolbasics"><b>Access Control</b></a></li><li><a href="#certificatesbasics"><b>Certificates</b></a></li><li><a href="#encryptionbasics"><b>Encryption</b></a></li><li><a href="#auditingbasics"><b>Auditing</b></a></li><li><a href="#standardsused"><b>Standards Implemented</b></a></li><li><a href="#getstarted"><b>Setting Up Security</b></a></li></ul><h2><a name="wizards"></a>The New Task Wizards</h2><p>IIS 5.0 included three new security task wizards which are
also available in IIS 5.1. The Certificates Wizard makes
obtaining and managing server certificates easier. The CTL Wizard
makes creating and managing certificate trust lists easier. These
two wizards replace the procedures previously used in IIS for these
tasks. The Permissions Wizard makes setting permissions on
directories and files easier. (Permissions can still be set by the
procedures used in NTFS and earlier versions of IIS.) For more
information, see <a href="sec_auth_certtaskwiz.htm"><b>Using the New Security Task Wizards</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="authenticationbasics">
Authentication Overview</a></h2><p>Internet Information Services provides security features that
are fully integrated with Windows. Six methods of authentication
are supported so that you can confirm the identity of anyone
requesting access to your Web sites:</p><ul><li><b>Anonymous authentication</b> allows anyone access without
asking for a user name or password.</li><li><b>Basic authentication</b> prompts the user for a user name
and password, which are sent <i>unencrypted</i> over the
network.</li><li><b>Digest authentication</b> operates much like Basic
authentication except that the passwords are sent as a <i>hash</i>
value. Digest authentication is available only on domains with a
Windows 2000 domain controller.</li><li><b>Advanced Digest authentication</b> Advanced Digest
authentication is identical to Digest authentication, except that
Advanced digest stores the client credentials as an MD5 hash in
Active Directory on your Windows Whistler domain controller for
improved security.</li><li><b>Integrated Windows authentication</b> uses hashing
technology to identify your user without actually sending the
password over the network.</li><li><b>Certificates</b> are digital credentials that can be used to
establish a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. They can also be
used for authentication.</li></ul><p>You can use these methods to grant access to public areas of
your site, while preventing unauthorized access to your private
files and directories. See <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm"><b>About Authentication</b></a> to learn more about the different ways that you
can use authentication on your Web server.</p><h2><a name="accesscontrolbasics"></a>Access Control Overview</h2><p>With NTFS access permissions, the foundation of your Web
server's security, you can define the level of file and directory
access granted to Windows users and groups. For example, if a
business decides to publish its catalog on your Web server, you
need to create a Windows user account for that business and then
configure permissions for the specific Web site, directory, or
file. The permissions should permit only the server administrator
and the owner of the business to update the Web site's contents.
Public users should be allowed to view the Web site, but cannot
alter its contents. For more details about setting NTFS
permissions, see <a href="sec_acc_ntfssetperm.htm"><b>Setting NTFS Permissions for a Directory or File</b></a>.</p><p>WebDAV is an extension of the HTTP 1.1 protocol that facilitates
file and directory manipulation over an HTTP connection. Through
the use of WebDAV "verbs," or commands, properties can be added to
and read from files and directories. Files and directories can also
be remotely created, deleted, moved, or copied. Additional access
control can be configured through both Web server permissions and
NTFS. For more information, see <a href="sec_acc_aboutacc.htm"><b>About Access Control</b></a> or <a href="pub_dav_webdav.htm"><b>WebDAV Publishing</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="certificatesbasics"></a>Certificates Overview</h2><p>Certificates are digital identification documents that allow
both servers and clients to authenticate each other. They are
required for the server and client's browser to set up an SSL
connection over which encrypted information can be sent. The
certificate-based SSL features in IIS consist of a server
certificate, a client certificate, and various digital keys. You
can create these certificates with Microsoft Certificate Services
or obtain them from a mutually trusted, third-party organization
called a certification authority (CA). For more information on
setting up certificates and keys, see <a href="sec_auth_certsetssl.htm"><b>Setting Up SSL on Your Server</b></a>.</p><h3>Server Certificates</h3><p>Server certificates provide a way for users to confirm your Web
site's identity. A server certificate contains detailed
identification information, such as the name of the organization
affiliated with the server content, the name of the organization
that issued the certificate, and a <i>public key</i> used in
establishing an encrypted connection. This information helps to
assure users of the authenticity of Web server content and the
integrity of the secure HTTP connection. For more information, see
<a href="sec_auth_certabout.htm"><b>About Certificates</b></a>.</p><h3>Client Certificates</h3><p>With SSL, your Web server also has the option of authenticating
users by checking the contents of their client certificates. A
typical client certificate contains detailed identification
information about a user and the organization that issued the
certificate and a <i>public key</i>. You can use client certificate
authentication, along with SSL encryption, to implement a highly
secure method for verifying the identity of your users. For more
information, see <a href="sec_auth_certabout.htm"><b>About Certificates</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="encryptionbasics"></a>Encryption
Overview</h2><p>You can enable users to exchange private information with your
server, such as credit card numbers or phone numbers, in a secure
way by using encryption. Encryption "scrambles" the information
before it is sent, and decryption "unscrambles" it after it is
received. The foundation for this encryption in IIS is the
SSL 3.0 protocol, which provides a secure way of establishing
an encrypted communication link with users. SSL confirms the
authenticity of your Web site and, optionally, the identity of
users accessing restricted Web sites.</p><p>Certificates include <i>keys</i> used in establishing an SSL
secure connection. A <i>key</i> is a unique value used to
authenticate the server and the client in establishing an SSL
connection. A <i>public key</i> and a <i>private key</i> form an
SSL <i>key pair</i>. Your Web server utilizes this key pair to
negotiate a secure connection with the user's Web browser to
determine the level of encryption required for securing
communications.</p><p>For this type of connection, both your Web server and the user's
browser must be equipped with compatible encryption and decryption
capabilities. During the exchange, an encryption key, or <i>
session</i> key, is created. Both your server and the Web browser
use the session key to encrypt and decrypt transmitted information.
The session key's degree of encryption, or <i>strength</i>, is
measured in <i>bits</i>. The greater the number of bits comprising
the session key, the greater the level of encryption and security.
Although these greater encryption key strengths offer greater
security, they also require more server resources to implement.
Your Web server's session key is typically 40 bits long, but can be
128 bits long depending upon the level of security you require. For
more information, see <a href="sec_encryp_encryption.htm"><b>Encryption</b></a>.</p><h4><a name="H2_448415275"></a>Server-Gated Cryptography</h4><p>Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC) offers financial institutions the solution for worldwide secure financial transactions using 128-bit encryption. SGC is an extension of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) that allows financial institutions with export versions of IIS to use strong encryption.</p><p>Server-Gated Cryptography does not require an application running on the client's browser and can be utilized by standard export versions of IIS, version 4.0 or later. A server configured for SGC can facilitate both 128-bit and 40-bit encryption sessions, so multiple versions of IIS are not required. Although SGC capabilities are built into IIS 4.0 and later versions, a special SGC certificate is required to use SGC. Contact your certification authority for availability information. For more information about SGC, see the article titled <b>Secured online banking goes global!</b> at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&amp;sbp=sgc&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=security" target="_New"><b>Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC)</b></a> Web site.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you open your SGC certificate, you might receive a notice on the <b>General</b> tab saying, "The certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes." This notice is issued because of the way SGC certificates interact with Windows 2000 and does not necessarily indicate that the certificate does not work properly.</p>
<h4><a name="H2_4484152755"></a>Selectable Cryptographic Service Provider</h4><p>Selectable Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) allows you to select a Microsoft or third party cryptographic provider to handle cryptography and certificate management. Each cryptographic provider can create a public and private key to encrypt data sent to and from the Web server.  The private key is stored at the server end on hardware, on a PCI card, on a SmartCard, or in the registry as it is for the two default providers that Microsoft installs: Microsoft DH SChannel Cryptographic Provider and Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider. The Microsoft Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI) for every provider contains identical methods and properties.  This allows for switching between providers without having to rewrite code. For more information on CSP and managing installed third-party cryptographic providers, see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/c-frame.htm?/workshop/security/capi/cryptapi.asp" target="_New"><b>Microsoft CryptoAPI Overview</b></a> on MSDN's Web Workshop. For the latest list of cryptographic service providers supporting Internet Information Services, select <b>Endorsements</b> in that page.</p><h2><a name="auditingbasics"></a>Auditing
Overview</h2><p>You can use security auditing techniques to monitor a broad
range of user and Web server security activity. It is recommended
that you routinely audit your server configuration to detect areas
where resources may be susceptible to unauthorized access and
tampering. You can use the integrated Windows utilities, or the
logging features built into IIS, or use Active Server Pages (ASP)
applications to create your own auditing logs. For more
information, see <a href="sec_audit_auditing.htm"><b>Auditing</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="standardsused"></a>Standards
Implemented</h2><p>Many of the security features in IIS implement Internet
community standards. These standards help to facilitate uniformity
and cross-platform utilization of applications and information.
Microsoft is committed to working with the Internet and computer
communities both in assisting to structure good standards, but also
in its implementation of those standards. For more information on
the standards implemented by the IIS security features, follow the
appropriate link in the following list:</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=Fortezza&amp;pver=1.0" target="_New"><b>Fortezza</b></a>. The U.S. government security
standard, commonly called Fortezza, is supported in IIS. This
standard satisfies the Defense Message System security architecture
with a cryptographic mechanism that provides message
confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and
access control to messages, components, and systems. These features
are implemented both with server and browser software and with
PCMCIA card hardware. Fortezza is a widely used security standard
within the U.S. government.</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=Netscape&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=SSL3" target="_New"><b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL 3.0)</b></a> is a
public key-based security protocol implemented by the Secure
Channel (Schannel) security provider. SSL security protocols are
used widely by Internet browsers and servers for authentication,
message integrity, and confidentiality.</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=W3org&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=specs" target="_New"><b>Basic Authentication</b></a> is a part of the HTTP 1.0
specification that sends password over networks in Base64 encoded
format. Most browsers support this specification.</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=W3org&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=specs" target="_New"><b>Digest Authentication</b></a> sends authentication
information over networks as a <i>hash</i> and is compatible with
proxy servers.</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=RSA&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=securitystandards" target="_New"><b>PKCS #7</b></a> describes the format of encrypted
data such as digital signatures or digital envelopes that securely
contain information. Both of these are involved in the certificate
features of IIS.</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=RSA&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=securitystandards" target="_New"><b>PKCS #10</b></a> describes the format of requests
for certificates that are submitted to certification
authorities.</p><p>For additional information about Windows and network security
issues, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=security" target="_New"><b>Microsoft Security Web site</b></a> or the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&amp;sbp=ntserver&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=security" target="_New"><b>Windows Security Web site</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="getstarted">Setting Up
Security</a></h2><p>Before configuring your Web server security, determine the level
of security that you will require to protect your Web and FTP
sites. For example, if you intend create a Web site that allows
special users to access private information, such as financial or
medical records, then you will require a robust security
configuration. This configuration should be able to reliably
authenticate designated users and restrict access to only those
users.</p><p>Much of your Web server's security relies on your Windows
security configuration. If you do not properly configure your
Windows security features, you cannot secure your Web server.</p><p>If you have not done so already, carry out the following:</p><ul><li>Configure the Windows Administrator account.</li><li>Create and manage user accounts.</li><li>Create and manage groups.</li><li>Define Windows security policies.</li></ul><p>For more information, consult the Windows documentation. The
Microsoft Windows Whistler Server Resource Kit is also an
excellent source for security information.</p><p>As part of your security configuration, you should also convert
your hard disk partition to an NTFS partition. NTFS hard disk
partitions offer precise file and directory access control, and
save information more efficiently than File Allocation Table (FAT)
partitions. You can use the Windows Convert utility to convert a
hard disk partition to NTFS. For more information, consult your
Windows documentation.</p><p>Next, determine which files and directories will be publicly
available to users visiting your Web and FTP sites. Keep public and
restricted content in separate directories.</p><p>To get started configuring your Web server's security, see <a href="sec_acc_aboutacc.htm"><b>About Access Control</b></a> for
information about properly configuring anonymous Web server
access.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
