<h2>Server-Side Includes</h2><h6>Overview</h6><p>Modularity and reusability of code can be very useful in your
development of ASP scripts. For example, if you want to display
copyright information on the bottom of each of your HTML pages and
ASP pages, ASP provides a solution to this problem: server-side
includes, which are directives to the server to include a certain
file, which can be a text file, graphical image, or an ASP
function. The copyright notice can exist as one file, and be
included into the rest of your Web site's files. And if the
copyright notice changes, you only have to change one file instead
of 50 or 500.</p><p>The syntax for including a file is:</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- #include PathType=Name --&gt;
</code></pre><p>The <i>PathType</i> parameter consists of a keyword, either FILE
or VIRTUAL, which indicates whether the <i>Name</i> string
specified is a physical or virtual path.</p><h6>Code Tour</h6><p>This example uses the <b>#include</b> directive to include the
file HeaderInfo.asp. When this script is executed, ASP loads the
script line by line, character by character, until it gets to the
<b>#include</b> directive, at which point it loads the contents of
the designated file, line by line. Then the remainder of the sample
script is loaded; once this is finished the script is executed,
included file and all.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If the file that your ASP script includes contains
a large number of functions and variables that are not used by the
including script, the extra resources occupied by these unused
structures can adversely affect performance, and ultimately
decrease the scalability of your Web application. Therefore, it is
generally advisable to break your include files into multiple
smaller files, and include only those files required by your ASP
script, rather than include one or two larger include files that
may contain unneeded information.</p>
