<h1>About Access Control</h1><a name="aboutauthentication"></a><p>Properly controlling access to your Web and FTP content is
crucial for running a secure Web server. With Windows and the
security features in IIS, you can effectively control how users
access your Web and FTP content. You can control access on multiple
levels, from entire Web and FTP sites to individual files.</p><ul><li><a href="#anonaccess"><b>Anonymous Access</b></a></li><li><a href="#dav"><b>Distributed Authoring and Versioning</b></a></li><li><a href="#overviewaccess"><b>How Access Control Works</b></a></li><li><a href="#guidelines"><b>Guidelines for Controlling
Access</b></a></li></ul><h2><a name="anonaccess">Anonymous Access</a></h2><p>Anonymous access, the most common Web site access control
method, allows anyone to visit the public areas of your Web sites
while preventing unauthorized users from gaining access to your Web
server's critical administrative features and private
information.</p><p>For example, if you imagine your Web server as a museum,
enabling Anonymous access is like inviting the public to visit the
museum's public galleries and exhibits. However, you would probably
lock particular rooms, such as offices and laboratories, that you
did not want the public to visit. Similarly, when you configure
Anonymous access for your Web server, you can apply NTFS
permissions to prevent ordinary users from accessing private files
and directories. For more information about NTFS permissions, read
the paragraph below detailing <a href="#NTFSpermissions"><b>NTFS
Permissions</b></a>.</p><p>By default, your Web server will log on all users through use of
the anonymous account. During installation, your server creates a
special anonymous user account called IUSR_<i>computername</i>. For
example, if your computer name is SalesDept1, then the anonymous
account name is IUSR_SalesDept1. Each Web site on your server can
use either the same or different anonymous user logon accounts.
With the Windows Local User and Groups utility, you can create a
new "anonymous logon" user account. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm"><b>About Authentication</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="dav"></a>Distributed Authoring and
Versioning</h2><p>Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of
the HTTP 1.1 standard for exposing any storage media, such as a
file system, over an HTTP connection. With the IIS implementation
of WebDAV, you can allow remote authors to move, search, or delete
files and directories and their properties on your server. WebDAV
is configured by using Web server permission settings. For more
information, see <a href="pub_dav_webdav.htm"><b>WebDAV Publishing</b></a>.</p><p>You can set WebDAV permissions for:</p><ul><li>Searching for directories and files and their properties.</li><li>Creating, modifying, deleting, and browsing directories and
files and their properties.</li><li>Storing and retrieving custom properties for files and
directories.</li><li>Locking files for collaborative working environments.</li></ul><p>WebDAV operates on both File Allocation Table (FAT) and NTFS.
For more detailed information on the WebDAV specification drafts,
search for <b>WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning</b> at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=W3org&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=protocols" target="_New"><b>World Wide Web Consortium</b></a> Web site. For more
information about NTFS, see <a href="sec_acc_ntfssecfiles.htm"><b>Securing Your Files with NTFS</b></a>.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>WebDAV is an implementation of the HTTP 1.1
proposed draft and is therefore not available for non-HTTP
services, such as FTP sites.</p>
<h2><a name="overviewaccess">How Access Control
Works</a></h2><p>You can control user access to your Web server content by
properly configuring your Windows file system and Web server
security features. When a user attempts to access your Web server,
the server carries out several access control processes to identify
the user and determine the allowed level of access.</p><img src="iiacnsc1.gif" alt="Access control flow chart"><p>The following is an outline of the process:</p><ol><li>The client requests a resource on the server.</li><li>The server, if configured to require it, will request
authentication information from the client. The browser may either
prompt the user for a user name and password, or offer this
information automatically. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm"><b>About Authentication</b></a>.</li><li>The IP address of the client is checked against any IP address
restrictions in IIS. If the IP address is denied access, then the
request fails and the user gets a "403 Access Forbidden"
message.</li><li>IIS checks if the user has a valid Windows user account. If the
user does not, then the request fails, and the user gets a "403
Access Forbidden" message.</li><li>IIS checks if the user has Web permissions for the requested
resource. If the user does not, then the request fails, and the
user gets a "403 Access Forbidden" message.</li><li>Any third-party security modules added by the Web site
administrator are used here.</li><li>IIS checks the NTFS permissions for the resource. If the user
does not have NTFS permissions for the resource, then the request
fails, and the user gets a "401 Access Denied" message.</li><li>If the user has NTFS permission, then the request is
fulfilled.</li></ol><h3><a name="H3_37682506">IP Address Access
Restrictions</a></h3><p>You can configure your Web server to prevent specific computers,
groups of computers, or entire networks from accessing your Web
server content. When a user initially tries to access your Web
server content, the server checks the IP address of the user's
computer against the server's IP address restriction settings. For
more information, see <a href="sec_acc_grantdeny.htm"><b>Granting and Denying Access to Computers</b></a>.</p><h3><a name="H3_37683323">Web Server
Permissions</a></h3><p>You can configure your Web server's access <i>permissions</i>
for specific sites, directories, and files. These permissions apply
to all users regardless of their specific access rights. For
example, you can disable the Read permissions for a particular Web
site to prevent user access while you update the site's content so
that when a user attempts to access the Web site, your server
returns an "Access Forbidden" error message. However, when you
enable the Read permission you allow all users to view your Web
site, unless NTFS permissions restrict which users can view the
site. For more information, see <a href="sec_acc_settwebperm.htm"><b>Setting Web Server Permissions</b></a>.</p><p>The Web permission levels include:</p><ul><li><b>Read</b> (selected by default) Users can view file
content and properties.</li><li><b>Write</b> Users can change file content and
properties.</li><li><b>Script Source Access</b> Users can access source files.
If Read is selected, then source code can be read, if Write is
selected, then source code can be written to. Script Source Access
allows access to the source code for files, such as the scripts in
an ASP application. This option is only available if either Read or
Write is checked.</li><li><b>Directory browsing</b> Users can view file lists and
collections.</li><li><b>Log visits</b> A log entry is created for each visit to
the Web site.</li><li><b>Index this resource</b> Allows Indexing Service to
index this resource.</li></ul><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Web server permission settings affect which HTTP
verbs can be used for a site, virtual directory, or file.</p>
<h3><a name="NTFSpermissions">NTFS
Permissions</a></h3><p>Internet Information Services relies on NTFS permissions for
securing individual files and directories from unauthorized access.
Unlike Web server permissions, which apply to all users, you can
use NTFS permissions to precisely define which users can access
your content and how those users are allowed to manipulate that
content.</p><p>NTFS permission levels include:</p><ul><li><b>Full Control</b> Users can modify, add, move, and
delete files, and their associated properties, and directories. In
addition they can change permissions settings for all files and
subdirectories.</li><li><b>Modify</b> Users can view and modify files and file
properties, including deleting and adding files to a directory or
file properties to a file.</li><li><b>Read &amp; Execute</b> Users can run executable files,
including scripts.</li><li><b>List Folder Contents</b> Users can view a list of a
folder's contents.</li><li><b>Read</b> Users can view files and file properties.</li><li><b>Write</b> Users can write to a file.</li><li><b>No Access</b> When no check boxes are selected, users
have absolutely no access to the resource, even if a user has
access to a higher-level parent directory.</li></ul><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Setting No Access permissions for the
IUSR_<i>computername</i> account for a resource will result in
anonymous users being denied access to that resource.</p>
<p>You define a list of permissions, also known as an discretionary
access control list (DACL), for individual files or directories.
When you define this list, you select a particular Windows user
account or user group, and then specify an access permission for
that user or group.</p><p>The following table illustrates the contents of the permission
list for the imaginary Microsoft Word document, <i>
MYSERVER:\Administration\Accounts.doc</i>:</p><table width="" height=""><tr><th width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>User Account or User Groups</b></th><th width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Permissions</b></th></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MYSERVER\Administrators</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Full Control</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MYSERVER\JeffSmith</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Change</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MYSERVER\Guests</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">No Access</td></tr></table><p>Aside from members of the Administrator group, only the account
named <i>JeffSmith</i> has permission to make changes to
Accounts.doc. Ordinary users logged on as members of the Windows
Guests user group would be explicitly denied access to this
file.</p><p>After you set NTFS permissions, your Web server needs a way to
identify, or <i>authenticate</i>, users prior to granting access to
restricted files. You can configure your server's authentication
features to require users to log on with a valid Windows account
user name and password. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm"><b>About Authentication</b></a>.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Incorrectly set NTFS DACLs may cause the
browser to prompt the user for user information. For example the
user may be not have access to a file (because of the DACLs) and
IIS will issue an access denied error which may cause the browser
to prompt the user to enter a different user name and password.</p>
<p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Making your server secure involves removing
unnecessary users and groups, or groups that are too general for
your purposes. However, removing the Everyone group from the DACLs
on your Web resources without further modification will cause even
non-anonymous access to fail. If you want to have non-anonymous
access work correctly you must have the following permissions plus
any specific users or users groups:</p>
<ul><li>Administrator [full control]</li><li>Creator/Owner [full control]</li><li>System [full control]</li></ul><p>For procedural information, see <a href="sec_acc_ntfssecfiles.htm"><b>Securing Your Files with NTFS</b></a>
and <a href="sec_acc_ntfssetperm.htm"><b>Setting NTFS Permissions for a Directory or File</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="guidelines">Guidelines for Controlling
Access</a></h2><p>You can reduce the likelihood of your Web server becoming
susceptible to a security threat by using the following guidelines.
When you implement them with a judicious access control policy and
properly configured security features, you can achieve a reliable
security configuration.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>For highly sensitive security applications, such as
those involving the financial and banking industries, you should
seek the assistance of a professional security consulting firm. A
consulting firm can assist in setting up proper security policies
and procedures.</p>
<p>To properly safeguard Web server content, your security policy
should include the following guidelines:</p><h3><a name="H3_37687994">Maintain a Strong
Password Policy</a></h3><p>Unauthorized individuals can gain access to your Web server by
stealing or guessing user account passwords. You must make sure
that all passwords, especially those used for protecting
administrative privileges, are difficult to guess. To select <i>
strong</i> passwords, use the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Avoid selecting common words as passwords. An individual intent
on compromising your system can use a special dictionary look-up
program to try to guess your password.</li><li>Require passwords to be greater than eight characters long,
containing both uppercase and lowercase letters. Passwords should
also include numbers, and, if possible, nonstandard
characters.</li><li>Require users to regularly change passwords.</li></ul><h3><a name="H3_37688822">Limit Access to Web
Server Administrative Privileges</a></h3><p>Be sure to limit the access to your Web server's <i>
Administrators</i> group. Members of the Administrators group have
complete control over your entire Web server and its security
features. Use the following practices for controlling membership of
the Administrators group:</p><ul><li>Grant Administrator privileges only to trusted
individuals.</li><li>Use the Administrator account only to administer your network
domain. For Internet browsing use a separate user account with
privileges similar to the Windows user group Guest. This will limit
the processes on your computer exposed to the Internet.</li><li>When creating new user groups, avoid assigning Full Control
permissions that allow users to freely manipulate content.</li><li>Periodically change the Administrator account password.</li><li>Never run untrusted programs while logged on as
Administrator.</li><li>Use SSL security features when administering your Web server
remotely.</li></ul><h3><a name="H3_37689712">Maintain Strict Account
Policies</a></h3><p>Use the Windows Group Policy utility to specify <i>user rights
policies</i> for Windows user groups. User rights policies define
the Web server and Windows administrative actions that a user can
perform. For example, you can establish a policy that ensures that
public users do not have the right to remotely shut down your Web
server. As a rule, try to establish very restrictive user rights
policies. Avoid accidentally giving users the ability to alter your
Web server and its resources. For more information, see the Windows
documentation or the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server
Resource Kit.</p><p>For more information on Web server security, see the <i>IIS
Resource Guide</i> volume of the Microsoft Windows 2000
Server Resource Kit.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
