<h1>Configuring CGI Applications</h1><p>Internet Information Services supports CGI applications. This
topic provides administrative information on installing and
configuring CGI applications on the Web server. For general
information on programming CGI applications, refer to Microsoft's
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msdn&amp;ar=library&amp;pver=6.0" target="_New"><b>MSDN Online Library</b></a>.</p><p>CGI programs are executed when the Web server receives a URL
that contains the CGI program name and any parameters required by
the program. If your CGI program is compiled into an executable
(.exe) file, you must give the directory that contains the program
Execute permission so that users can run the program. If your CGI
program is written as a script, for example a Perl script, then you
can give the directory either Execute permission or Script
permission. To use Script permission, the script interpreter must
be marked as a script engine.</p><p>If you are considering developing new CGI applications,
Microsoft provides several alternatives that you should explore.
For faster execution, consider developing an ISAPI extension
instead. For ease of development, consider developing an ASP
application. ASP is particularly attractive for new programmers or
scripters because it handles many of the chores traditionally
associated with writing CGI applications, such as parsing HTTP
headers. For more information, see <a href="asp_asp.htm"><b>Getting Started with ASP</b></a>.</p><h6>To install and configure CGI applications:</h6><br><ol><li>Set up a directory for your CGI programs. For extra security,
you should separate your CGI programs from your content files. You
do not need to name the directory Cgi-bin, although you can do so
if you want. See <a href="qss_wss_createvirtdir.htm"><b>Creating Virtual Directories</b></a>.</li><li>If your CGI programs are scripts, obtain and install the
appropriate script interpreter. For example, to run Perl scripts,
you must obtain a Perl interpreter. 

<p>The Windows operating systems do not provide versions of Perl,
SED, or AWK. Theses interpreters can be obtained from third-party
developers.</p></li><li>If your CGI programs are .exe files, give the directory Execute
permissions. If your CGI programs are scripts, you can give the
directory either Execute or Script permission. See <a href="sec_acc_accesscontrol.htm"><b>Access Control</b></a>. 

<p>If you choose Script permission, you must mark the script
interpreter as a script engine in the property sheets for the
directory. Only interpreters that are marked as script engines are
allowed to execute in the directory. Executable files (.dll and
.exe files) cannot be directly executed; that is, a browser request
cannot launch an executable file <i>on the Web server</i> by
including the program name in the URL. Enabling <b>Script</b>
permission with the <b>Script Engine</b> option allows you to
safely put content files (such as .htm or .gif files) in the same
directory as your CGI scripts. Content files are displayed in the
browser and scripts are executed, but no one can run an
unauthorized program nor are script commands displayed in the
browser.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>If you give Read permissions to directories
that contain executable files, visitors to your site can download
and run your executable files. For security purposes, you should
always keep executable files in a separate directory that does not
have Read permissions set.<br></p>
</li><li>For CGI scripts, create an application mapping between the file
name extension of your script and the script interpreter. 

<p>Internet Information Services maps file name extensions to an
interpreter. For example, if you are using Perl scripts stored in
files with a .pl extension, map the .pl extension to the program
that runs Perl scripts. Map .bat and .cmd files to the command
interpreter (Cmd.exe). See <a href="ca_settappmappings.htm"><b>Setting Application Mappings</b></a>.<br></p></li><li>Set NTFS permissions. 

<p>If you are using NTFS access permissions, verify that all users
who need to run the program have Execute permissions for the
directory. If your Web site accepts anonymous users, be sure the
anonymous user (the IUSR_<i>computername</i> account) has Execute
permissions.<br></p></li></ol><p>Internet Information Services supports most of the standard
server environment variables.</p><p>If your script accesses a script mapped to Cmd.exe running on a
remote server, the default working directory is set to %SYSTEM32%
on the local computer. The default value of %SYSTEM32% is
\Winnt\System32 (on Windows 2000 or later) and \Win95\System
(Windows 95 or later).</p><p>For greater security, the Web server does not pass the command
interpreter's special characters to a mapped CGI application. By
default, the following characters cannot be included in the URL
that calls the CGI application:</p><pre>
| ( , ; % &lt; &gt;
</pre><p>Although not recommended, you can enable the use of some of the
special characters by changing the value of <b>
AllowSpecialCharsInShell</b> in the registry. For more information,
see <a href="ref_reg_wwwservice.htm"><b>WWW Service Registry Entries</b></a>.</p><div class="search-terms">(The following words are used by Search;
