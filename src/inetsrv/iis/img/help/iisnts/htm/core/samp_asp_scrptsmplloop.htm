<h2>Looping</h2><h6>Overview</h6><p>Looping is one of the most important flow-control mechanisms in
a programming language. Looping constructs provide the foundation
for any application that must repetitively perform a task, such as
adding 1 to a variable, reading a text file, or processing an
e-mail message and sending it.</p><h6>Code Tour</h6><p>VBScript and JScript provide several looping mechanisms. This
sample demonstrates the three most commonly used looping
statements, <b>For ... Next</b>, <b>Do ... Loop</b>, and <b>While
... Wend</b>. These three statements are subtly different, and the
scripting situation will frequently dictate which of the three
would work best. For the purpose of this sample, however, each type
of looping statement is used to accomplish the same task, which is
to print a greeting five times using progressively larger font
sizes. For each looping statement, the variable <i>i</i> is
initialized, and the test condition for the loop is defined such
that <i>i</i> will never be greater than 5. The variable is then
incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
