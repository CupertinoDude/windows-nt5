<h1>Additional Security Considerations</h1><h3>Registry Issues</h3><p>Many IIS applications require resources provided by other
software components. For instance, an ISAPI extension DLL may call
an Automation server from a third-party software company, or a CGI
application may launch a program built with
Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual Basic<sup>®</sup>. These
components may have persistent information stored in the registry
that they require in order to execute properly. For standard
desktop use of these components, the registry information is read
from the profile of the user currently logged on a computer with
Windows. These applications often have problems when launched by
IIS because the profile made available to an IIS application is
that of the default user. The default-user profile is filled with
information generic to all users, but is specific to no users.
Therefore, a component may run as expected when User1 executes it
on his or her desktop because it is reading information from
User1's profile in the registry. The same application may not run
at all from IIS because it will not have access to User1's profile.
This is true even if IIS is impersonating User1's account by using
Basic or integrated Windows authentication.</p><h3>Desktop Issues</h3><p>Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000 uses the concept of having
multiple desktops on the same computer. A desktop can be thought of
as the screen that you view when you are logged on your computer.
Your desktop receives all the mouse and keyboard messages that you
send as the user at the computer, and it allows for applications to
interact with one another to a certain extent. For instance, one
application on a desktop can post messages to other applications on
the desktop. Support for multiple desktops implies that there are
other desktops running; you just can't see them and you have no way
of sending keyboard or mouse messages to them. This may seem like a
futile concept, but, in fact, many applications that run as Windows
services require the capabilities that a desktop provides but don't
want to interact with the interactive user's desktop. Therefore,
each service gets its own desktop that won't be interfered with by
the currently logged-on user.</p><p>If your IIS application interacts with a desktop in any way (for
instance, if it displays a message box), then it will display that
message box on a desktop that cannot be seen on the computer's
monitor. Similarly, an IIS application will not be able to send or
post messages to an application on the interactive desktop. If your
IIS application needs to interact with the interactive desktop,
then you should use another form of inter-process communication
such as Named Pipes. For more information see "Interprocess
Communication" in the Windows Base Services section of the Platform
SDK.</p><h3>ISAPI Filter DLLs</h3><p>ISAPI filter DLLs, not to be confused with ISAPI extension DLLs,
run in the original context of the IIS service. All services run by
default under the Local System account of the computer on which
they are installed. The Local System account has access to almost
all resources on the local computer not specifically denied to it,
and no resources on any other computers on the network.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
