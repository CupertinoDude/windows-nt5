<h1>Scaling Out</h1><p>Scaling out is the process of adding servers to an existing
server environment to improve performance and to increase the
number of Web sites that system can host or publish. Scaling out
reduces bottlenecks and lock contention because requests coming
into the system do not share resources. The request load is
balanced between the different servers, which makes the system more
robust when dealing with heavy traffic volumes and large file
downloads. If you are an ISP or if your Web presence is currently
struggling with scalability and performance issues because of high
traffic volumes or binary large object downloads (BLOB), scaling
out maybe be a solution.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>See the <a href="perf_mon.htm"><b>Performance Monitoring</b></a> section to learn about the tools and counters that
can help you locate where your performance and scalability problems
originate. Scaling out requires the purchase of more equipment and
software licenses, so you need to understand exactly what is
causing your performance and scalability issues before deciding to
scale out. Also keep in mind that scalability and performance
result vary depending on your configuration, your site, and the
size/types of files being downloaded.</p>
<h2>Web Farms</h2><p>The best way to guarantee the availability and reliability of
your Web services is to publish your site with more than one
computer, called a Web Farm.</p><p>With several computers, your server environment can easily
handle large volumes of client requests without creating unwanted
delays. Sharing the load among more than one computer is especially
vital for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that supports critical
applications: for instance, those that conduct financial
transactions, access databases, support corporate intranets,
and perform other key functions on a daily basis.</p><p>Setting up a Web farm involves clustering and load balancing.
For more information about these concepts and for the specific
processes for setting up replication and clustering on IIS, see the
Windows Whistler online Help.</p><h2>Web Gardens</h2><p>A Web garden is an application pool that has multiple processes
serving the requests routed to that pool. You can configure the Web
garden to affinitize the processes serving it to a given set of
CPU's on a multi-processor system. Using Web gardens, Web
applications have increased scalability because a lock does not
block all processors in the multi-processor machine. If one worker
process serving a pool experiences an ASP lock, the other worker
processes are still able to serve content and take over for the
locked worker process. Web Gardens take advantage of <a href="ca_dedappmode.htm"><b>Dedicated Application Mode</b></a> and <a href="ca_processrecycling.htm"><b>Process Recycling</b></a>. To
enable and configure a Web garden, see <a href="ca_webgardens.htm"><b>Web Gardens</b></a>.</p><div><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li>For more information about Web Clusters, Web Farms, or Network
