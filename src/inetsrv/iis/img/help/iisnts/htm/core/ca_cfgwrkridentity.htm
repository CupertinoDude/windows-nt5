<h2>Configurable Worker Process Identity</h2><p>Worker processes can be configured to run under a lower
privileged account than LocalSystem, which provides greater
security and reliability. This is configurable on an application
pool basis, much like process recycling and CPU throttling. For
instance, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) wants to allow
customers to upload CGI applications. To contain the applications
and protect the systems, the ISP can allow the applications to
execute under a special worker process identity. This prevents a
flaw in a component running as LocalSystem enabling an attacker to
take control of the computer on which it is running, and access
information to attack other computers.</p><p>For more information about configuring the identity of a worker
process, see "xxx".</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
