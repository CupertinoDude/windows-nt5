<h1>About Server-Side Includes</h1><p>You can use server-side include (SSI) directives to include
text, graphics, or application content into a Web page just before
sending that content to the browser. SSI can be used to include,
for example, a time/date stamp, a copyright notice, or a form for a
customer to fill out and return. Including a file is an easy way to
incorporate text or graphics that are repeated in many files.
Rather than typing the content into every file, you save the
content into an include file. The include files is called through a
simple statement that instructs the Web server to insert the
content into applicable Web pages. Furthermore, you need only to
change the content in one place when you use include files.</p><p>Because a file containing SSI directives requires special
processing, you must give any SSI files an SSI file name extension.
The default extensions are .stm, .shtm, and .shtml. You can add
additional extensions to the list recognized by the Web server; see
<a href="ca_settappmappings.htm"><b>Setting Application Mappings</b></a>.</p><p>The Web server processes SSI directives while it is processes
the Web page. When the Web server reaches an SSI directive, it
inserts the contents of the include file directly into the HTML
page. And if the include file contains an SSI directive, that file
is also inserted. In addition to the basic directive used to
include a file, you can use SSI directives to insert information
about a file (such as its size) or to run an application or a shell
command.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="ref_ssi_ssiref.htm"><b>Server-Side Includes Reference</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
