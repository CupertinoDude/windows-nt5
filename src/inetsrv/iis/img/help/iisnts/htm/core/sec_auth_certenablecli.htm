<h1>Enabling Client Certificates</h1><p>You can require users attempting to access your Web site to log
on with a client certificate. Requiring a client certificate,
however, does not protect your content from unauthorized access.
Any user with a client certificate can establish a secure
connection and access your resource. To protect your Web content
from unauthorized access you must do either of the following:</p><ul><li>Use Basic, Digest, or integrated Windows authentication, in
addition to requiring a client certificate.</li><li>Create a Windows account mapping for client certificates. For
more information, see <a href="sec_auth_mapclient.htm"><b>Mapping Client Certificates to User Accounts</b></a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Your Web server cannot process client certificates unless you
have previously installed a server certificate and enabled your
server's secure communication features. For more information about
authentication and certificates, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm"><b>About Authentication</b></a> and <a href="sec_auth_certobtainsrv.htm"><b>Obtaining a Server Certificate</b></a>.</li><li>When you attempt to set properties for a specific Web site,
your Web server will prompt you for permission to reset the
properties of individual directories and files in the Web site. If
you choose to reset these properties, your previous settings will
be replaced by the new settings. The is also true for setting
properties for a directory containing subdirectories or files with
previously set security properties. For more information about
setting properties, see Properties and Inheritance of Properties on
Sites in <a href="wsa_webftp_aboutwebftp.htm"><b>About Web and FTP Sites</b></a>.</li></ul><p> </p><h6>To enable client certificates</h6> <ol><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select a Web
site, directory, or file, and open its property sheets.</li><li>If you have not previously obtained a server certificate,
select the <b>Directory Security</b> property sheet, under <b>
Secure Communications</b>, click <b>Server Certificate</b>. For
more information, see <a href="sec_auth_certtaskwiz.htm"><b>Using the New Security Task Wizards</b></a>.</li><li>If you have previously obtained a server certificate, select
the <b>Directory Security</b> or <b>File Security</b> property
sheet, then under <b>Secure Communications</b>, click <b>
Edit</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Secure Communications</b> dialog box, select the <b>
Require secure channel (SSL)</b> check box. Requiring a secure
channel means that user cannot connect to this site without using a
secure link (that is, the link's URL must begin with
https://).</li><li>Under <b>Client certificates</b> select one of the following to
enable client certificate authentication: 

<ul><li><b>Accept client certificates</b> Users can access the
resource with a client certificate, but the certificate is not
required.</li><li><b>Require client certificates</b> The server will request
a client certificate before connecting the user to the resource.
Users without a valid client certificate will be denied
access.</li><li><b>Ignore client certificates</b> Users with or without a
client certificate will be granted access.</li></ul></li></ol><hr class="iis" size="1">
