<h1>Dedicated Application Mode</h1><p>When configured to execute in dedicated application mode, all
application code runs in an isolated environment. This design
removes some of the existing bottlenecks and points of contention.
Dedicated application mode allows the administrator to isolate
anything from an individual Web application to multiple sites in
their own self-contained Web service process. This prevents one
application or site from stopping another. In addition, separating
applications or sites into separate processes simplifies a number
of management tasks, such as restarts (independent of all other
sites or applications running on the system), changing a component
used by the application, debugging, monitoring counters, throttling
resources, and so forth.</p><p>Some of the benefits of this mode are illustrated in the
following features:</p><table width="" height=""><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Feature</b></td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Multiple application pools</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Multiple application pools can be configured uniquely.</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Recyclable worker processes</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Worker processes can be configured to automatically restart

from multiple consecutive failures by disabling the failing
