<h1>Basic Authentication</h1><p>The Basic authentication method is a widely used,
industry-standard method for collecting user name and password
information.</p><h3>Client Authentication Process</h3><ol><li>The Internet Explorer Web browser displays a dialog box where a
user enters his or her previously assigned Windows account user
name and password, also known as credentials.</li><li>The Web browser then attempts to establish a connection to a
server using the user's credentials. The clear text password is
Base64 encoded before it is sent over the network. 

<p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Base64 encoding is not encryption. If a Base64
encoded password is intercepted over the network by a network
sniffer, unauthorized persons can easily decode and reuse the
password.</p>
</li><li>If a user's credentials are rejected, Internet Explorer
displays an authentication dialog window for the user to re-enter
his or her credentials. Internet Explorer allows the user three
connection attempts before failing the connection and reporting an
error to the user.</li><li>When your Web server verifies that the user name and password
correspond to a valid Microsoft Windows user account, a connection
is established.</li></ol><p>The advantage of Basic authentication is that it is part of the
HTTP specification and is supported by most browsers. The
disadvantage is that Web browsers using Basic authentication
transmit passwords in an unencrypted form. By monitoring
communications on your network, someone can easily intercept and
decode these passwords using publicly available tools. Therefore,
Basic authentication is not recommended unless you are confident
that the connection between the user and your Web server is secure,
such as with a dedicated line or a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
connection. For more information, see <a href="sec_encryp_encryption.htm"><b>Encryption</b></a>.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b><a href="sec_auth_intwinauth.htm"><b>Integrated Windows Authentication</b></a> takes precedence over Basic
authentication. The browser chooses integrated Windows
authentication and attempts to use the current Windows logon
information before prompting the user for a user name and password.
Currently, only Internet Explorer versions 2.0 and later
support Integrated Windows authentication.</p>
<h2><a name="enablebasic">Configuring Basic
Authentication</a></h2><p>Enabling Basic authentication does not automatically configure
your Web server to authenticate users. Windows user accounts must
be created and the NTFS permissions properly set, as described
earlier.</p><p>To properly authenticate users with Basic authentication, the
Windows user accounts must have Log On Locally user rights. This
right must be assigned because Basic authentication impersonates a
local user, or a user physically logged on to the server. By
default, user accounts on a Windows primary domain controller (PDC)
are not granted the Log On Locally user rights. You can grant users
Log On Locally rights by using the Active Directory Service
Interfaces (ADSI). For information, see the <a href="ref_mb_logonmethod.htm"><b>LogonMethod</b></a> reference in the
Active Server Pages Guide.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>The Basic authentication method
transmits user names and passwords across the network in an
unencrypted form. You can use your Web server's encryption
features, in combination with Basic authentication, to secure user
account information transmitted across the network. For more
information, see <a href="sec_encryp_aboutencryp.htm"><b>About Encryption</b></a>.</p><h3><a name="toenablebasic">To enable basic
authentication</a></h3><ol><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select a
site, directory, or file, and open its property sheets.</li><li>Select the <b>Directory Security</b> or <b>File Security</b>
property sheet. Either the <b>Directory Security</b> or <b>File
Security</b> property sheet is present, depending upon what level
you are changing the security settings.</li><li>In the <b>Authenticated Access</b> section, select the <b>Basic
authentication</b> check box.</li></ol><p>You must select a default logon domain. For more information,
see <a href="sec_auth_setdeflogon.htm"><b>Setting the Default Logon Domain</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
