<h1>Obtaining a Client Certificate</h1><p>You can obtain a client certificate from a trustworthy,
third-party organization, called a <i>certification authority</i>.
Before issuing a certificate, the authority may need to verify your
identity. The identification information required by the authority
can vary depending on the type of certificate you want to obtain.
How these certificates are obtained and implemented depends upon
the browser being used. The procedures in this topic are for
Internet Explorer version 3.0 and later, only. For client
certificate procedures for other browsers, see the browser
documentation.</p><h6>To obtain a client certificate</h6><br><ol><li>Choose a certification authority. Consider the following issues
when choosing a certification authority: 

<ul><li>Is the certification authority a well known and trusted
organization?</li><li>What type of information will the authority require from you in
order to verify your identity? Most certification authorities will
require you to provide detailed identification information, such as
your name, address, organization name, and e-mail address.</li><li>Does the authority have a Web site that you can use to request
your client certificate?</li><li>Are the certificates issued compatible with the browser and
server being used?</li></ul><p>For the latest list of certification authorities supporting
Internet Information Services, visit the <a href="http://microsoft.com/technet/security/partners/default.asp" target="_New"><b>Microsoft Security Services Partner Program</b></a> Web
site. In the <b>Search by Product &amp; Technology</b> list, select
<b>IIS</b> or <b>PKI and Certificates</b>.</p></li><li>Refer to specific ordering instructions provided by the
certification authority.</li><li>Order your certificate. Some client certificates are valid only
for the computer and Web browser used to generate the certificate
request: for these be sure to make the online request from the
computer where you intend to install the certificate.</li><li>When you receive your client certificate, use your Web
browser's security features to install the certificate. (Some Web
browsers may refer to client certificates as <i>browser</i> or <i>
personal</i> certificates.)</li></ol><hr class="iis" size="1">
