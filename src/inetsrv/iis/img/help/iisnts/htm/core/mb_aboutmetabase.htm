<h1>About the Metabase</h1><a name="AboutThemetabase"></a><p>The metabase is a hierarchical store of configuration values
used by IIS that incorporates rich functionality such as
inheritance, data typing, change notification, and security. 
The metabase configuration for IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 was stored in a
proprietary binary file, and was not easily readable or
editable.  IIS 6.0 replaces the proprietary binary file called
metabase.bin, with plain text XML formatted files called
MetaBase.XML and MBSchema.XML.</p><p>The benefits of XML formatted plain text metabase files are as
follows:</p><ul><li>The metabase files can be edited directly using common text
based tools</li><li>Improved troubleshooting and metabase corruption recovery</li><li>Improved backup/restore capabilities on machines that
experience critical failures</li><li>metabase Schema can be extended by an administrator using
ADSI</li><li>100% compatibility with IIS 5.0 metabase API's and ADSI</li><li>Improved performance and scalability</li></ul><h2>The metabase files can be edited directly using common text
editing tools</h2><p>The text based XML metabase allows administrators to easily read
and edit the metabase files directly without having to use scripts,
code, or the IIS snap-in to administer IIS. For more information,
see <a href="mb_ewr_aboutewr.htm"><b>About Editing the MetaBase.xml File While IIS Is
Running</b></a>.</p><h2>Improved troubleshooting and metabase corruption recovery</h2><p>The XML metabase eases diagnosis of potential metabase
corruption because the metabase is stored in a plain-text files
that can be easily read using common text based tools such as
Microsoft Notepad and compared using tools like the Windows
Resource Kit utility Windiff. As the metabase is edited and saved,
IIS makes versioned copies of the MetaBase.XML and MBSchema.XML
files in a <a href="mb_history_history.htm"><b>The Metabase History Feature</b></a>. The
history files can be used to compare changes that were made to
MetaBase.XML.</p><h2>Improved backup/restore capabilities on machines that
experience critical failures</h2><p>The backup and restore capabilities of IIS 6.0 have improved
over IIS 5.0 by allowing an administrator to back up the metabase
with an administrator password. This allows the metabase to be
restored on a different computer or a different installation of
Windows Whistler in the event of a critical failure. Additionally,
the metabase can be restored with a previous version of the
Metabase.XML and or MBSchema.XML file from the history folder. For
more information, see <a href="mb_rely_reliability.htm"><b>Metabase Reliability</b></a>.</p><h2>Metabase Schema can be Extended by an Administrator </h2><p>The XML metabase uses schema to enforce what properties can be
written, and at what locations in the metabase the properties can
be written, as well as enforcing the data types that can be used
for a particular attribute. The schema can be extended using ADSI
so that custom applications can store information in the metabase.
For more information, see <a href="mb_structure_schema.htm"><b>Metabase Schema</b></a>.</p><h2>100% compatibility with IIS 5.0 metabase API's and ADSI</h2><p>Because the XML metabase is fully compatible with IIS 5.0
metabase API's and ADSI, existing scripts and code will continue to
work. For more information about the interfaces to the metabase,
see <a href="mb_config_about.htm"><b>About Configuring the Metabase</b></a>.</p><h2>Improved performance and scalability</h2><p>The new XML metabase improves performance and scalability. The
new XML metabase has:</p><ul><li>Comparable or better disk footprint size to the IIS 5.0
metabase.</li><li>Faster read times on Web server startup than the IIS 5.0 binary
metabase.</li><li>Equivalent write performance to the IIS 5.0 binary
metabase.</li></ul><div class="search-terms">metabase, overview,</div>
