<h1>Introduction to Active Server Pages</h1><p>Microsoft® Active Server Pages (ASP) is a <i>server-side
scripting</i> environment that you can use to create and run
dynamic, interactive Web server applications. With ASP, you can
combine HTML pages, script commands, and COM components to create
interactive Web pages or powerful Web-based applications, which are
easy to develop and modify.</p><h2><a name="H2_37764454">For the HTML
Author</a></h2><p>If you are an HTML author, you will find that server-side
scripts written in ASP are an easy way to begin creating more
complex, real-world Web applications. If you have ever wanted to
store HTML form information in a database, personalize Web sites
according to visitor preferences, or use different HTML features
based on the browser, you will find that ASP provides a compelling
solution. For example, previously, to process user input on the Web
server you would have had to learn a language such as Perl or C to
build a conventional Common Gateway Interface (CGI) application.
With ASP, however, you can collect HTML form information and pass
it to a database using simple server-side scripts embedded directly
in your HTML documents. If you are already familiar with scripting
languages such as Microsoft VBScript or Microsoft® JScript®
(JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the ECMA 262 language
specification), you will have little trouble learning ASP.</p><h2><a name="H2_37765707">For the Experienced Web
Scripter</a></h2><p>Since ASP is designed to be language-neutral, if you are skilled
at a scripting language such as VBScript, JScript, or PERL, you
already know how to use Active Server Pages. What more, in your ASP
pages you can use any scripting language for which you have
installed a COM compliant scripting engine. ASP comes with VBScript
and JScript scripting engines, but you can also install scripting
engines for PERL, REXX, and Python, which are available through
third-party vendors.</p><h2><a name="H2_37766314">For the Web Developer
and Programmer</a></h2><p>If you develop back-end Web applications in a programming
language, such as Visual Basic, C++, or Java, you will find ASP a
flexible way to quickly create Web applications. Besides adding
scripts to create an engaging HTML interface for your application,
you can build your own COM components. You can encapsulate your
application's business logic into reusable modules that you can
call from a script, from another component, or from another
program.</p><h2><a name="theactiveserverpagesmodel">The Active Server Pages
Model</a></h2><p>A server-side script begins to run when a browser requests an
.asp file from your Web server. Your Web server then calls ASP,
which processes the requested file from top to bottom, executes any
script commands, and sends a Web page to the browser.</p><p>Because your scripts run on the server rather than on the
client, your Web server does all the work involved in generating
the HTML pages sent to browsers. Server-side scripts cannot be
readily copied because only the result of the script is returned to
the browser. Users cannot view the script commands that created the
page they are viewing.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
