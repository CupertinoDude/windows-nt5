<h1>Developing Scalable Web Applications</h1><h6>Performance</h6><p>In the world of single-user desktop software development, the
performance requirements are clearly defined. In that context, it
is important that the user does not experience a significant delay
when performing common tasks.</p><p>In the early years of the World Wide Web, slow Web pages were
commonplace, and for many users a long wait was tolerated. However,
as more and more enterprise Web applications were created, the
requirements for Web application performance began to rival those
of the single-user desktop. Today, with faster communication
technologies becoming prevalent, users are demanding greater
increases in site performance.</p><h6>Scalability</h6><p>The real issue in Web application design is that while the
application <i>appears</i> to the single user as a traditional
desktop application, it is actually a distributed application that
could be simultaneously servicing hundreds or even thousands of
users.</p><p>Web applications demand performance under a wide range of
environment conditions-in other words, they must be scalable.
Certainly, Web applications must perform well, but good performance
when being used by a single user does not necessarily translate
into scalability.</p><p>There are many different metrics for determining how scalable an
application is. Ideally, a truly scalable Web application should be
able to:</p><ul><li>Serve a single user as well as it can serve hundreds or
thousands of simultaneous users.</li><li>Perform twice as well when installed on a computer with twice
the resources (processors, RAM, and so on), perform three times as
well on a computer with three times the resources, and so on.</li></ul><p>Of course, these scalability requirements are <i>ideals</i>.
However, the closer your application comes to fulfilling those
ideals, the more successful your application will be when under
load.</p><h6>Design Considerations for Performance and Scalability</h6><p>The most important thing to keep in mind when beginning a Web
application development project is that Web applications are, for
the most part, server applications. Historically, server software
has been second only to operating system internals in complexity
and programming difficulty. IIS and Windows<sup>®</sup> offer a
variety of innovative tools that make Web application development
much faster and easier, but the concerns and challenges of server
software programming still exist.</p><p>Some important considerations for making your application
scalable include:</p><ul><li><b>Technology Choices:</b> As with any development platform,
Windows offers a number of options for completing a given task.
Making the correct choice of technologies is the first, and often
most important, step in designing a scalable Web application. For
example, if a client-side technology provides the same or similar
functionality as provided on the server, the client-side option
often makes more sense; as the application is more scalable because
the client handles much of the processing load. Proper technology
choices can also lead to fewer round-trips between the client and
server, further improving performance. For more information, see <a href="dwa_ovr_overview.htm"><b>Web Applications: An Overview</b></a> and
the Internet Client SDK.</li><li><b>Language Choices:</b> Choosing a development language
impacts your Web application by defining the range of users who
have access to it. For example, including scripting in an
application will exclude users who have browsers that do not
support scripting. The following lists some of the development
languages available: 

<ul><li>Windows Script Components</li><li>Visual Basic</li><li>Java</li><li>C++</li></ul></li><li><b>Algorithm and Work Flow Design:</b> Even the proper
technology, if used improperly, will yield poor results.</li><li><b>Multithreading:</b> IIS and Windows provides a multithreaded
environment, and in order to create scalable applications, you must
choose the appropriate threading model for your components.</li><li><b>Resource Contention and Delay:</b> Resource contention and
leakage are often major culprits behind applications that cannot
scale.</li><li><b>"Real-World" Testing:</b> You must be sure to thoroughly
test your Web application in an environment that approximates the
actual environment in which the application will be deployed.</li></ul><p>A detailed analysis of all of these topics is beyond the scope
of this documentation. Instead, in this section you will find a
compilation of notes and procedures, specific to IIS, that will
help you create a scalable Web application.</p><p>This section contains:</p><ul><li><a href="dwa_scl_devsclaspapps.htm"><b>Developing Scalable ASP Applications</b></a></li><li><a href="dwa_scl_devscacomps.htm"><b>Developing Scalable Components</b></a></li><li><a href="dwa_scl_deshiperfisapi.htm"><b>Designing High-Performance ISAPI Applications</b></a></li><li><a href="dwa_scl_dataaccperf.htm"><b>Data Access Performance</b></a></li><li><a href="dwa_scl_perfscltest.htm"><b>Performance and Scalability Testing</b></a></li></ul><p>For more information about designing Web applications, see <a href="dwa_des_desdec.htm"><b>Design Decisions</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
