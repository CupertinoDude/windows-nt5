<h1>Setting NTFS Permissions for a Directory or File</h1><p>You can control access to your Web server's directories and
files by setting NTFS access permissions. You can use NTFS
permissions to define the level of access that you want to grant to
specific users and groups of users, with valid Windows accounts.
Proper configuration of file and directory permissions is crucial
for preventing unauthorized access. For more information, see <a href="sec_acc_aboutacc.htm"><b>About Access Control</b></a> or the Windows
documentation.</p><p>When you share a directory or file, the default access settings
for NTFS directories and files grants <i>Full Control</i> access to
the Windows user group <i>Everyone</i>, which includes all users.
This means that all users have permission to modify, move, and
delete files or directories, and to change NTFS permissions. This
default setting may not be appropriate for all directories and
files.</p><p>Making your server secure involves removing unnecessary users
and groups, or groups that are too general for your purposes.
However, removing the Everyone group from the discretionary access
control list (DACL) on your Web resources without further
modification will cause even non-anonymous access to fail. If you
want to have non-anonymous access work correctly you must have the
following permissions in addition to any specific users or users
groups:</p><ul><li>Administrator [full control]</li><li>Creator/Owner [full control]</li><li>System [full control]</li></ul><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you do not see the <b>Security</b> tab in the
drive, directory, or file property sheets, your server's file
system is not configured as NTFS. To convert the file system to
NTFS, see the Windows documentation.</p>
<h6>To change NTFS permissions for a directory or file</h6><ol><li>Open <b>My Computer</b>, select the drive, directory, or file
you want to secure, and open its property sheets.</li><li>On the <b>Security</b> property sheet, select the Windows
account you want to change permissions for.</li><li>Under <b>Permissions</b>, select the types of access for the
selected user or group. Use <b>Allow</b> to specifically allow
access and <b>Deny</b> to specifically deny access. For more
choices, click <b>Advanced</b>. For more information about the
various permissions, see the Windows documentation.</li></ol><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Be careful when selecting <b>Deny</b>. <b>
Deny</b> takes precedence over <b>Allow</b>. Applying <b>Deny</b>
to the Everyone group might close the resource to that level of
access by <i>anyone</i>, including the Administrator.</p>
<h6>To add or remove Windows accounts to the NTFS permissions for a
directory or file</h6><ol><li>On the <b>Security</b> property sheet, click <b>Add</b> to add
users and groups or click <b>Remove</b> to remove users and
groups.</li><li>In the <b>Select Users, Computers, or Groups</b> dialog box,
select a computer or domain from the list or enter a name in the
<b>Name</b> text box. You can continue to add users or groups. The
lower list will contain those users and groups you have selected or
entered.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b> to add these to the list on the <b>Security</b>
property sheet.</li><li>In the <b>Name</b> list box, select a user or group that you
want to grant access to your file or directory.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If there are conflicts between your NTFS and Web
server permissions, the most restrictive settings will be used.
This means that permissions that explicitly deny access always take
precedence over those permissions that grant access.</p>
