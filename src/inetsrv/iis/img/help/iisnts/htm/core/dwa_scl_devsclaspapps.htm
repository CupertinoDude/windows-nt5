<h1>Developing Scalable ASP Applications</h1><h6>Proper Use of ASP</h6><p>With ASP, you can easily and quickly create Web applications, in
a fraction of the time it would take with a more conventional
server-side language, such as C or C++.</p><p>However, the ease with which you can create ASP-based
applications belies the complexity of the server processing and
client-server interaction required by that application. It is
possible that Web applications that have been created with
extensive ASP scripting will not scale well.</p><p>To avoid scalability problems, there are two points to keep in
mind when developing with ASP:</p><ul><li>ASP is the "Glue"</li><li>ASP should not be used for business logic</li></ul><p>The first point emphasizes that ASP dovetails with HTML,
client-side scripting using DHTML, and XML to create a powerful
platform for interacting with the user. ASP scripting was designed
to be used to bind the user interface to the business logic of the
Web application, and ASP was optimized for these sorts of
tasks.</p><p>The second point should serve as an important reminder: If you
find that most of your business logic is embedded into the ASP,
your application will probably not scale properly. It is true that
ActiveX<sup>®</sup> scripting languages, hosted by ASP, are <i>
capable</i> of accomplishing a great deal of business logic
processing. However, if the business logic required for your Web
application is more than trivial, then that business logic should
be folded into a new COM component, rather than embedded in ASP
scripts.</p><h6>Optimizing ASP on IIS</h6><p>Once you have established that your use of ASP is appropriate
for the design of your application, and you have encapsulated the
bulk of your business logic into COM components, there are two
avenues by which you can further improve the performance and
scalability of your Web application:</p><ul><li><a href="dwa_scl_aspscriptingopt.htm"><b>ASP Scripting Optimization</b></a></li><li><a href="dwa_scl_iisconfigopt.htm"><b>IIS Configuration Optimization</b></a></li></ul><p>For more information about designing Web applications, see <a href="dwa_des_desdec.htm"><b>Design Decisions</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
