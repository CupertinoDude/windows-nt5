<h1>Scalability Testing</h1><p>Scalability and performance can be impacted on many levels,
which means any change to your server environment can potentially
impact performance and scalability in a negative way. For example,
one poorly designed custom built component can reduce the
performance of a server capable of processing thousands of requests
per second to 30 requests per second. Considering that all changes,
even changes designed to improve performance and scalability, have
the potential to negatively impact performance and scalability, it
is important to understand that there isn't a formula or checklist
for fixing all of your performance and scalability issues.
Improving performance and scalability requires theories and
testing. If you want to improve the performance and scalability of
your server environment, be prepared to test at every level and
test after every change. </p><p><b>Scalability Testing:</b> Goals for scalability testing are
typically aligned with scalability objectives. </p><table width="" height=""><tr><th width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Goal</th><th width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Scalability Testing</th></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><a href="perf_scal_scaleup.htm"><b>Scaling Up</b></a> (processor

(administering thousands of sites)</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Determining how many sites a given machine can handle, assuming
a constant load and a given throughput requirement.</td></tr></table><p>Before adding hardware, servers, or thousands of sites to a
server establish a baseline about the performance and scalability
of your server in a test environment that mimics your production
environment. Once you have established this baseline, you will know
very quickly if a change to your system has positive or negative
effects. Also, be sure to test applications for scalability. Adding
ASP or COM applications to your system can improve scalability but
those applications must constantly be tested to make certain they
are working properly. Be prepared to remove and redesign an
application if you determine through testing that the application
reduces your performance or scalability. </p><p>To help you establish a baseline and perform regular performance
and scalability testing, see <a href="perf_mon_tools.htm"><b>Tools Used to Monitor Performance</b></a> for a description
of the following monitoring tools.</p><ul><li>System Monitor</li><li>Event Viewer</li><li>Task Manager</li><li>Network Monitor</li><li>Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool (WAST)</li><li>Application Center Test (ACT)</li></ul><p>You can also monitor your server by examining logs generated by
IIS. These logs extend beyond those generated by
Windows Whistler. For information about logging, see the
topics listed in <a href="log_logging.htm"><b>Logging Site Activity</b></a>.</p><div><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li><a href="perf_mon_tools.htm"><b>Tools Used to Monitor Performance</b></a></li><li><a href="perf_tune.htm"><b>Performance Tuning</b></a></li><li><a href="perf_mon.htm"><b>Performance Monitoring</b></a></li></ul></div><hr class="iis" size="1">
