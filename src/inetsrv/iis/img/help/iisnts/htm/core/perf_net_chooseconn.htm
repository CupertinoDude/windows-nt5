<h1>Choosing the Right Connection</h1><p>You can choose the right connection for your situation by
mathematically figuring the average size of your content files, the
amount of time files of that size take to send, and the number of
simultaneous users you want to support. This topic shows you how to
perform the calculations necessary to select the right connection.
For convenience, a utility is available to do these calculations
for you. For more information, see <a href="perf_net_calcconn.asp#"><b>Calculating Connection
Performance</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="H2_37748960">Determining Connection
Type Based on File Transmission Speed</a></h2><p>You can select a connection type based on the size of files you
will be sending to users and the amount of time users are willing
to wait to receive a file. Generally, HTML text pages should load
within five seconds. External files, such as graphics or video,
should load within 30 seconds. If you will be using modems, be
aware that you must also factor in the time it takes for a data
packet to make the round trip between the user and your server.
Modem connections take nearly one second per connection, a
significant amount of time. Faster leased-line connections take 0.1
or 0.2 seconds, which is not significant and therefore not included
in calculations.</p><p><b>To estimate file size</b></p><ol><li>Multiply 8 bits per character X 80 characters per line X 66
lines per page = 42,240 bits per page.</li><li>For every 8 bits of data transferred, there are 4 bits of
overhead. Multiply 42,240 bits per page X 1.5 bits used to transfer
1 bit of data = 63,360 bits per page transferred.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>This calculation assumes a solid text page with no
graphics, most typically seen when converting text documents to
HTML format. The typical home page is generally much less text
intensive and is probably closer to 24,000 bits per page including
overhead. However, the typical home page may also contain one or
more graphics files, each requiring connections between the client
and the server.</p>
<p><b>To estimate transmission time</b></p><p>Divide the connection speed per second by the estimated file
size to get the following number of pages transmitted per
second:</p><table width="" height=""><tr><th width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Connection Type</th><th width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pages Transmitted</th></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dedicated PPP/SLIP</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.3 to 0.6</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">56K (Frame Relay)</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.9</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">ISDN (using PPP)</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.7</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">T1</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">24</td></tr><tr><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">T3</td><td width="" height="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">710</td></tr></table><p>For modems, add additional transmission time of one second to
open the connection. This means that a modem would take from 2.5 to
4 seconds to transfer one page, depending on the modem speed.</p><p><b>To determine the number of possible connections per day on a
T1 line</b></p><ol><li>Divide the 1,540,000 bps connection speed by the 12 bits per
byte transmitted to equal 125 KB per second transmitted.</li><li>Multiply 125 KB per second X 86,000 seconds per day =
10,777,994 KB per day transmitted.</li><li>Divide 10,777,994 KB per day by 1,048,576 (1024 KB per MB X
1024 MB per GB) = 10.3 GB per day transmitted.</li><li>Assuming an average file size (text and graphics) of 25 Kb,
divide 10,777,994 KB by 25 KB = 431,000 hits per day.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>This calculation assumes a T1 connection dedicated
to your Web server only.</p>
<p><b>To determine the number of simultaneous users a connection
type can support</b></p><ol><li>Assuming that you want to stay within the five-second
transmission time for a page of text, and assuming a text file size
of 63,360 bits transmitted for the user to receive the page, divide
the 63,360 bits by 5 seconds = 12,672 bits per second per
user.</li><li>Divide the connection speed by the bits per second per user.
For instance, for a T1 line, divide 1,540,000 bps by 12,672 bps per
user = 121 simultaneous users on a T1 connection.</li></ol><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>This assumes text-only pages with no graphics and a
complete page transmitted within five seconds. If more users
attempt to connect, they are not refused, but the transmission
speed of files may drop well below the five-second recommended
time. The following table provides guidelines for the number of
users expected to be supported by a connection type.</p>
