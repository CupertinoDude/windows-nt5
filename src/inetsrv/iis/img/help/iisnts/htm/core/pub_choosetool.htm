<h1>Choosing an Authoring Tool</h1><a name="H1_37703369"></a><p>This topic contains conceptual information about choosing an
authoring tool to meet your needs.</p><ul><li><a href="#righttool"><b>Understanding the Available
Options</b></a></li><li><a href="#multimedia"><b>Multimedia Content and Other File
Formats</b></a></li><li><a href="#WebApplications"><b>Advanced Web Site
Development</b></a></li></ul><h2><a name="righttool">Understanding the Available
Options</a></h2><p>Phenomenal growth of Internet and intranet technologies has
created high demand for an array of specialized Web authoring
tools. If you are new to Web publishing, choosing the proper tool
for your Web publishing needs can sometimes be confusing and
frustrating. For this reason, before selecting your authoring tool,
spend time familiarizing yourself with the major categories of
available tools.</p><h3>WYSIWYG</h3><p>If you are new to Web page authoring, you may want to use an
authoring tool that does not immediately require you to know HTML
so you can start publishing right away. Some tools feature a
WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") user interface similar to
those used in word processors, such as Microsoft® Word.
This means that if you know how to use a word processor, you can
create Web pages. Microsoft® FrontPage®  is a
good example of an easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor that has a friendly
user interface, convenient formatting wizards, and various
templates for easily adding tables or graphics to your Web pages.
As you create and edit your Web page, FrontPage displays the page
just as it would appear in a Web browser. FrontPage also has
special programmatic extensions that enhance the way it functions
with your Web server. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=frontpage express&amp;ar=home" target="_New"><b>Microsoft FrontPage</b></a> Web site.</p><h3>HTML Conversion</h3><p>An attractive alternative to creating your own Web pages is to
publish Web content by converting existing documents into HTML
documents. By importing your word processor and spreadsheet files
into a converter, you can quickly turn such files into Web pages.
Many word processing programs, such as Word, now feature HTML
conversion features. However, you should be aware that most
converters only add HTML formatting tags to your text and that some
converters will do a poor job of preserving the original appearance
of your documents. You will find converters especially useful,
however, if you plan to publish large amounts of existing
documentation that will not need frequent updating.</p><h3>A Text Editor</h3><p>Alternatively, you can also create Web pages with almost any
standard text editor, such as Notepad, by typing in the HTML tags,
saving the file, and then opening it in a Web browser. Some
experienced users prefer this method because it provides finer
control over Web page formatting, and enables users to quickly
implement and test the latest innovations in Web technology. If you
choose to create Web pages with a text editor, however, you need to
be fairly familiar with HTML and prepared to spend time
troubleshooting your HTML files.</p><p>There are also several <i>hybrid</i> tools that function similar
to a standard text editor. However, these tools contain many useful
shortcut features (such as those of a WYSIWYG editor) that enable
you to easily insert predefined HTML tags into your pages, thus
reducing extra typing. The Internet or your local computer software
vendor are good places to get more information. A particularly good
source of information about various commercially available Web
authoring tools is the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?Prd=msdn&amp;Ar=downloads" target="_New"><b>Microsoft MSDN Online</b></a> Web Site.</p><h2><a name="multimedia">Multimedia Content and
Other File Formats</a></h2><p>If you have spent any time exploring the Internet, you have
noticed that Web page content is not limited to text, tables, and
graphics. Sound and video have become integral components of
commercial Web sites. Using only standard HTML tags, you can add
engaging multimedia functionality to your Web pages. For example,
to embed a video clip in your Web page, use the DYNSRC attribute of
the HTML &lt;IMG&gt; tag:</p><pre>
 &lt;IMG DYNSRC="MyVideo.avi" &gt;
</pre><p>The video clip MyVideo.avi plays after the user loads a Web page
containing this tag.</p><p>To implement advanced multimedia functionality, such as
streaming video, you may need to use specialized editing and
creation software. With Microsoft® Windows Media
Technologies™ you can easily create, deliver, or play
streaming media files. To learn more about streaming media
technology, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=windows&amp;ar=windowsmedia" target="_New"><b>Microsoft® Windows Media</b></a> Web
site.</p><p>With HTML, you can also create links to numerous other file
formats, including Microsoft Office files. For users to be able to
view such formats, they must have Web browsers capable of viewing
non-HTML files. For example, if you know that all of an intranet's
users have Microsoft® Excel and
Microsoft® Internet Explorer, version 3.0 or later,
you can link to Excel worksheets from your Web site. When the user
clicks the link, the document appears in Excel format in the user's
Web browser. This is a powerful method you can use for creating Web
sites that share and distribute documentation, helping people to
work more effectively.</p><h2><a name="WebApplications">Advanced Web
Site Development</a></h2><p>Today most commercial Web sites use sophisticated, interactive
Web pages to provide users with informative and engaging types of
content. These Web sites, often described as <i>Web
applications</i> or <i>Weblications</i>, use processing programs,
called <i>scripts</i>, to retrieve information in response to user
inputs. An online book or clothing store that offers you choices
and tracks your selections is a perfect example of a Web
application.</p><p>A useful type of Web application that you can create is an
Active Server Pages (ASP) application. ASP applications contain <i>
server-side</i> scripts and commands processed exclusively by the
server. You can use ASP server-side scripts to add database
connectivity to your Web sites or to deliver Web content tailored
to the capabilities of a user's Web browser. To learn how you can
start using ASP, see <a href="asp_asp.htm"><b>Getting Started with ASP</b></a>.</p><p>When you feel ready to tackle building Web applications, you
will need a reliable and versatile authoring tool.
Microsoft®  Visual InterDev™ is a powerful Web
application development tool that you can use to rapidly build
leading edge Web sites. Visual InterDev features a set of
integrated database tools that greatly simplify connecting your Web
site to OLE DB data sources and Open Database Connectivity
(ODBC)-compliant databases. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=vinterdev&amp;ar=home&amp;pver=6.0" target="_New"><b>Microsoft Visual InterDev</b></a> Web site.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
