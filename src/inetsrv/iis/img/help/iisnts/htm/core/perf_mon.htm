<h1>Performance Monitoring</h1><p>Monitoring is an essential part of server administration. By
monitoring a server's performance, you can spot problematic trends
as they develop and prevent larger performance problems. Monitoring
also helps you decide when to upgrade your hardware and whether
upgrades are actually improving your server's performance. While
some problems are obvious, others develop over time. If you do not
have a baseline against which to judge and compare the performance
of your servers, you can experience problems that you might have
avoided. This section describes how to use System Monitor and the
Performance Logs and Alerts tool, along with other monitoring
tools, to monitor server performance.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Internet Information Services 6.0 (IIS) utilizes
two modes of operation: Standard mode (default) and <a href="ca_dedappmode.htm"><b>Dedicated Application Mode</b></a>. IIS
typically scales and performs better while running in <a href="ca_dedappmode.htm"><b>Dedicated Application Mode</b></a>, though
results depend on a variety of factors, including the design of
your applications. Also note that each mode requires different
counters when monitoring performance. The differences are noted in
the relevant topics.</p>
<p>This section contains the following topics:</p><ul><li><a href="perf_mon_about.htm"><b>About Performance Monitoring</b></a>:
<b></b>This topic is a high-level overview of performance
monitoring and includes descriptions of response time, resource
utilization, and performance bottlenecks.</li><li><a href="perf_mon_tools.htm"><b>Tools Used to Monitor Performance</b></a>: This topic describes a variety of Windows
tools used to monitor performance and scalability.</li><li><a href="perf_mon_apps.htm"><b>Monitoring Your Web Applications</b></a>: This topic describes how to monitor and tune
applications for improved performance.</li><li><a href="perf_mon_hardware.htm"><b>Measuring Hardware Performance</b></a>: This topic describes counters related to memory,
processor capacity, and multiprocessor systems. This topic also
describes the following concepts and makes recommendations on how
to monitor and improve performance accordingly: processor affinity,
network capacity, latency, bandwidth, disk optimization, and
security.</li></ul><p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/servers/" target="_New"><b>
