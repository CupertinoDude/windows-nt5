<h1>About Encryption</h1><p>Sensitive information transmitted across an unsecured network

, such as the Internet,
can potentially be intercepted by a computer vandal. For this
reason, if you plan to provide users with access to Web sites that
process sensitive financial or personal information, you need to
protect your network links with encryption.</p><ul><li><a href="#Howencryptworks"><b>How Encryption Works</b></a></li><li><a href="#pub-keyencryption"><b>Public Key Encryption</b></a></li><li><a href="#encryptstrength"><b>Session Key Encryption
Strength</b></a></li></ul><h2><a name="Howencryptworks">How Encryption
Works</a></h2><p>Encryption is the process of scrambling information by applying
a mathematical function in such a way that it is extremely
difficult for anyone other than an intended recipient to retrieve
the original information. Central to this process is a mathematical
value, called a <i>key</i>, which is used by the function to
scramble the information in a unique and complex way.</p><p>Your Web server uses essentially the same encryption process to
secure communication links with users. After establishing a secure
link, a special <i>session</i> key is used by both your Web server
and the user's Web browser to both encrypt and decrypt information.
For example, when an authenticated user attempts to download a file
from a Web site requiring a secure channel, your Web server uses a
session key to encrypt the file and related HTTP headers. After
receiving the encrypted file, the Web browser then uses a copy of
the same session key to recover the file.</p><p>This method of encryption, although secure, has an inherent
drawback: During the process of creating a secure link, a copy of
the session key might be transmitted across an unsecured network.
This means that a computer vandal intent on compromising the link
need only intercept and steal the session key. To safeguard against
this possibility, however, your Web server implements an additional
method of encryption.</p><h2><a name="pub-keyencryption">Public Key
Encryption</a></h2><p>Your Web server's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security feature
utilizes a technique known as <i>public key</i> encryption to
shield the session key from interception during transmission.
Public key encryption, which involves the use of two additional
keys, a <i>private</i> and a <i>public</i> key, works in the
following manner:</p><ol><li>The user's Web browser establishes a secure (https://)
communication link with your Web server.</li><li>The user's Web browser and your server engage in negotiation to
determine the degree of encryption to use for securing
communications.</li><li>Your Web server sends the browser its public key.</li><li>The Web browser encrypts information used in generating a
session key with the server's public key and sends it to the
server.</li><li>Using the private key, your server decrypts the message,
generates a session key, encrypts it with the public key, and sends
it to the browser.</li><li>Your Web server and the browser both use the session key to
encrypt and decrypt transmitted data.</li></ol><img src="iicrysc.GIF" alt="Diagram of encryption and decryption"><p>Notice that the private key serves an important role in ensuring
that your communication link remains secure. You should take every
reasonable precaution to protect the private key from loss or
theft. You can back up your certificate by copying it to floppy
disk and keeping it in a safe place. Likewise, if you suspect that
your private key has been compromised, notify your certification
authority, use the Web Server Certificate Wizard to create a new
certificate request, and then obtain a new server certificate. For
more information, see <a href="sec_auth_certtaskwiz.htm"><b>Using the New Security Task Wizards</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="encryptstrength">Session Key
Encryption Strength</a></h2><p>A session key's <i>strength</i> is proportional to the number of
binary <i>bits</i> comprising the session key file. This means that
session keys with a greater number of bits have a greater degree of
security, and are considerably more difficult to forcibly
decode.</p><p>When a user attempts to establish a secure communication channel
with your Web server, the user's browser must negotiate the
strongest possible level of encryption, or session key strength,
that can be used to secure communications over that channel. This
means that both your Web server and the user's browser must be
equipped with compatible session key encryption and decryption
capabilities. For example, when you configure your Web server to
require a session key with a minimum 40-bit (default) encryption
strength, a user attempting to secure a connection must have a Web
browser capable of processing information with a 40-bit session
key.</p><div><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li>For more information about encryption, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/c-frame.htm?/workshop/security/capi/pkcb/crypt1.asp" target="_New"><b>
