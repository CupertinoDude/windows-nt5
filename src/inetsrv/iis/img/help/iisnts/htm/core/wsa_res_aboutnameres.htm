<h1>About Name Resolution</h1><a name="H1_37717004"></a><p>In order for people to reach your site on an intranet

or the Internet, you
must have a unique IP address that identifies your computer on the
network. This address takes the form of a long string of numbers
separated by dots (for example, 172.16.255.255). Because a numeric
address is difficult for people to remember, text names or
"friendly names" are used to provide visitors with an
easy-to-remember address, such as www.microsoft.com. Name
resolution involves supplying the correct numerical address from
the friendly name that was typed into a client browser. This
section describes different name resolution systems.</p><ul><li><a href="#IntranetNameResolutionSystems"><b>Intranet Name

Systems</a></h2><p>An <i>intranet</i> is a private local area network (LAN) that
uses Internet technology. To receive and deliver information
packets successfully, each computer's IP address must be
successfully mapped to its text name. The names and addresses can
be assigned by using any of several different name-to-address
resolution systems. You should make your choice based on the size
of your intranet, how often computers are added or moved, and the
software installed on Microsoft®</p>Windows Whistler
Server. The following sections describe how
computers on intranets receive their names and addresses. 

<h3><a name="H3_37718937">IP Address
Assignment</a></h3><p>IP addresses can be assigned in two ways: static or dynamic.
Your network can use either static IP addresses, dynamic IP
addresses, or a mixture of both.</p><ul><li><b>Static</b> The system administrator assigns and tracks
IP addresses for each computer on the intranet. Static assignment
works best on small, infrequently changing networks 

, or when you want to run multiple
sites (each responding to a different IP address) on one
installation of IIS.</li><li><b>Dynamic</b> A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) server temporarily <i>leases</i> an IP address to a client
when the client logs on to the network. When a client logs on, the
DHCP server assigns an IP address from its pool of currently
available addresses. As the end of the lease approaches, the client
computer negotiates with the server to renew the lease if
necessary. When the client logs off, the address is released again
and can be reassigned to a new client. A DHCP server relieves the
system administrator of the burden of tracking IP address
assignment and is particularly useful on large or frequently
changing networks. A DHCP server permits only one IP address to be
assigned to each computer on the network.</li></ul><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you want to assign multiple IP addresses to one
network card, then you must use a static address assignment for
that computer.</p>
<h3><a name="H3_37720420">Name Resolution
Systems</a></h3><p>Windows networking components rely on the NetBIOS naming
convention. In contrast, TCP/IP components rely on a naming
convention known as the Domain Name System (DNS). Under Windows,
the DNS host name defaults to the same name as the NetBIOS computer
name. The mapping of computer names to IP addresses can be done in
two ways:</p><ul><li><b>Static</b> The system administrator creates a text
file, called a HOSTS file (for DNS names), or an LMHOSTS file (for
NetBIOS names), and enters each computer's name and IP address. The
file is then distributed on the network. When a request for a
connection to another computer is made, the file is used to resolve
the name to the correct IP address. This system works well for
simple networks that change infrequently.</li><li><b>Dynamic</b> When a client computer logs on, a DHCP
server assigns an address and sends the IP address assignment to a
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server. The WINS server
registers the computer's name, and when a request is made for a
NetBIOS computer name, the WINS server resolves the name to the
correct IP address. This automatic recognition and mapping of
computer names and addresses eases the administrative burden of
large or frequently changing networks.</li></ul><p>DNS names are typically resolved using static information. The
DNS server contains a portion of the static database listing host
names and addresses. If the requested name is not in the DNS
server's portion of the database, it sends a query to other DNS
servers to get the requested information. The DNS server that runs
on Windows can be configured to query a WINS server for name
resolution of the lower levels of the DNS hierarchical naming
structure. Because WINS assigns computer names dynamically, this
effectively changes DNS from a static system to a dynamic
system.</p><p>If you are setting up multiple Web or FTP sites on a single
server, and each site has its own IP address, you may encounter
problems with automatic DNS registration. To ensure correct IP
binding and DNS registration, disable Windows Whistler Server
automatic DNS registration and manually configure DNS registration
for the sites. For more information about disabling automatic DNS
registration and manually configuring DNS registration, see the
Windows Whistler Server documentation.</p><p>If you want to assign multiple names to one computer, you must
use a static name assignment for the computer. On one computer you
can map multiple names to one IP address; or you can use multiple
names, each one mapped to its own IP address. For more conceptual
information about naming sites, see <a href="#AssigningNamestoVirtualServers"><b>Hosting Multiple Sites by
Assigning Ports, Addresses, and Host Header Names</b></a> later in this
section. For procedural help, see <a href="wsa_namingwebsites.htm"><b>Naming Web Sites</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="InternetNameResolutionSystems">Internet Name
Resolution</a></h2><p>On the Internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve
text ("friendly") names to IP addresses for sites. This section
describes how name resolution works.</p><p>The DNS names are recorded by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=internic&amp;pver=1.0" target="_New"><b>InterNIC</b></a>, an organization that manages name and
address assignment on the Internet. InterNIC operates a distributed
database that contains all the registered domain names. When a
client computer requests a connection to a site using a domain
name, the request is transmitted to a series of computers called
the Domain Name Servers.</p><p>The Domain Name Servers are located in thousands of
organizations around the world. The Domain Name Servers return the
IP address that corresponds to the requested domain name, and then
the client request is routed to the appropriate site. <a href="wsa_res_getaddress.htm"><b>Getting an Internet Name and Address</b></a> contains information about registering a domain name
for your site.</p><h2><a name="AssigningNamestoVirtualServers">Hosting Multiple Sites by
Assigning Ports, Addresses, and Host Header Names</a></h2><p>This section explains how to assign identification information
to Web sites. Each Web site has a unique, three-part identity it
uses to receive and to respond to requests:</p><ul><li>A port number</li><li>An IP address</li><li>A host header name</li></ul><p>By changing one of these three identifiers, you can host
multiple sites on a single computer.</p><h3><a name="portnumbers">Port Numbers</a></h3><p>By using appended port numbers, your site would only need one IP
address to host many sites. In order for clients to reach your
site, they would need to append a port number at the end of the
static IP address (except for the default Web site, which uses
port 80). The following graphic depicts a computer using port
numbers to host multiple Web sites.</p><img src="iivsovr4.gif" alt="A computer hosting three Web sites by using port numbers."><p>Using this method of hosting multiple sites requires clients to
type in the actual numerical IP address followed by a port number.
Host names or "friendly names" cannot be used.</p><h3><a name="multi_ip">Multiple IP Addresses</a></h3><p>To use multiple IP addresses, you must add the host name and its
corresponding IP address to your name resolution system (typically
DNS). Then clients need only type the text name in a browser to
reach your Web site. If you use multiple IP addresses, you will
need an additional network card for each IP address. The following
graphic depicts a computer using multiple IP addresses to host
multiple Web sites.</p><img src="iivsovr5.gif" alt="A computer hosting three Web sites by using multiple IP addresses."><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you are using this method to host multiple sites
on the Internet, you also need to register the text names with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=internic&amp;pver=1.0" target="_New"><b>InterNIC</b></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="hostheader">Host Header Names</a></h3><p>Finally, you can also use host header names with a single static
IP address to host multiple sites. Like the previous method, you
still add the host name to your name resolution system (typically
DNS). The difference is that once a request reaches the computer,
IIS uses the host name passed in the HTTP header to determine which
site clients are requesting. The following graphic depicts a
computer using host header names to host multiple Web sites.</p><img src="iivsovr6.gif" alt="A computer hosting three Web sites by using host header names."><p>If you are using this method to host multiple sites on the
Internet, you also need to register the friendly names with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&amp;sbp=internic&amp;pver=1.0" target="_New"><b>InterNIC</b></a>.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>You cannot use host headers when using Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) because HTTP requests using SSL are encrypted.
Host headers are part of the encrypted request and cannot be
interpreted and routed to the correct site.</p>
<p>Be aware that older browsers are unable to pass host header
names back to IIS. Microsoft® Internet Explorer 3.0,
Netscape Navigator 2.0, and later versions of both browsers
support the use of host header names; earlier versions of the two
browsers do not.</p><p>Visitors using older browsers reach the default Web site for the
IP address and need additional support to reach the correct site.
For instructions to enable host header support for older browsers,
see <a href="wsa_suphosthead.htm"><b>Supporting Host Header Names in Older Browsers</b></a>. For instructions on how to assign names, see <a href="wsa_namingwebsites.htm"><b>Naming Web Sites</b></a>. To find out how
to add additional sites to your IIS installation, see <a href="wsa_hmws_addsites.htm"><b>Adding Sites</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
