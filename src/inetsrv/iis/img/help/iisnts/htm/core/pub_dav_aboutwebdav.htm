<h1>About WebDAV</h1><p>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) extends the
HTTP/1.1 protocol to allow clients to publish, lock, and manage
resources on the Web. Integrated into IIS, WebDAV allows clients to
do the following:</p><ul><li><b>Manipulate resources</b> in a WebDAV publishing directory on
your server. For example, with this feature, users with the correct
permissions can copy and move files around in a WebDAV
directory.</li><li><b>Modify properties</b> associated with certain resources. For
example, a user can write to and retrieve a file's property
information.</li><li><b>Lock and unlock resources</b> so that multiple users can
read a file concurrently, but only one person at a time can modify
the file.</li><li><b>Search</b> the content and properties of files in a WebDAV
directory.</li></ul><p>Setting up a WebDAV publishing directory on your server is as
straightforward as setting up a virtual directory through the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>. Once you have set up your
publishing directory, users with the correct permissions can
publish documents to the server and manipulate files in the
directory. Before you can set up a WebDAV directory, you must
install Windows Whistler Professional, Windows
Whistler Server, or Windows Whistler Advanced Server.</p><h2>WebDAV Clients</h2><p>You can access a WebDAV publishing directory through one of the
Microsoft products described in the following list or through any
other client that supports the industry standard WebDAV
protocol.</p><ul><li><b>Windows Whistler</b> connects to a WebDAV server through the
Add Network Place Wizard and displays the contents of a WebDAV
directory as if it were part of the same file system on your local
computer. Once connected, you can drag and drop files, retrieve and
modify file properties, and do many other file-system tasks.</li><li><b>Internet Explorer 5</b> connects to a WebDAV directory
and lets you do the same file-system tasks as you can through
Windows Whistler.</li><li><b>Office 2000</b> creates, publishes, edits, and saves
documents directly into a WebDAV directory through any application
in Office 2000.</li></ul><h2>Searching in WebDAV</h2><p>Once connected to a WebDAV directory, you can quickly search the
files on that directory for content as well as properties. For
example, you can search for all files that contain the word <i>
table</i> or for all files written by <i>Fred</i>.</p><h2>Integrated Security</h2><p>Because WebDAV is integrated with Windows Whistler and IIS, it
borrows the security features offered by both. These features
include the IIS permissions specified in the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> and the discretionary
access control lists (DACLs) in the NTFS file system. For
information about IIS security, see <a href="sec_security.htm"><b>Security</b></a>.</p><p>Because clients with proper permissions can write to a WebDAV
directory, it is vital that you can control who is accessing your
directory at all times. To help control access, IIS has reinforced
Integrated Windows authentication by building in support for the
Kerberos 5 authentication protocol. By selecting Integrated
Windows authentication, you can make sure that only clients with
permission can access and write to the WebDAV directory on your
intranet. For more information about how the Kerberos 5
authentication protocol works with IIS Integrated Windows
authentication, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#challenge"><b>
Integrated Windows Authentication</b></a>. For information about how
the Kerberos protocol works in general, see "Kerberos v5
Authentication" in the Windows Whistler Server
documentation.</p><p>In addition, IIS supports Digest authentication and Advanced
Digest authentication. Created for Windows domain servers, Digest
and Advanced authentication offers tighter security for passwords
and for transmitting information across the Internet. For
information about Digest authentication, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#digest"><b>Digest Authentication</b></a> and
<a href="sec_auth_eacauth.htm#enabledigest"><b>Configuring Digest
Authentication</b></a>. For information about Advanced Digest
Authentication, see <a href="sec_auth_aboutauth.htm#advancedDigest"><b>Advanced Digest
Authentication</b></a> and <a href="sec_auth_eacauth.htm#enableadvanceddigest"><b>Configuring
Advanced Digest Authentication</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
