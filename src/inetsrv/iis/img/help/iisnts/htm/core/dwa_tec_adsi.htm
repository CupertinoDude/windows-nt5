<h1>Active Directory Service Interfaces</h1><p>Microsoft Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) is a
COM-based directory service model that allows ADSI-compliant client
applications to access a wide variety of distinct directory
protocols, including Windows<sup>®</sup> Directory Services,
LDAP, and NDS, while using a single, standard set of interfaces.
ADSI shields the client application from the implementation and
operational details of the underlying data store or protocol.</p><p>An application called an ADSI provider makes itself available to
ADSI client applications. The data exposed by the provider is
organized in a custom namespace, defined by the provider. In
addition to implementing the interfaces defined by ADSI, the
provider also can implement the ADSI schema. The schema is used to
provide metadata about the namespace structure and objects that are
provided by the ADSI provider. Property attributes should only be
set at property creation time.</p><p>For more information about ADSI, refer to the Active Directory
Service Interfaces Version 2.0 SDK and the Active Directory
Schema SDK in the Platform SDK.</p><h6>ADSI and IIS</h6><p>IIS currently stores most Internet site configuration
information in a custom data store called the IIS metabase. IIS
exposes a low-level DCOM interface that allows applications to gain
access to, and manipulate, the metabase. To make it easy to access
the metabase, IIS also includes an ADSI provider that wraps most of
the functionality provided by the DCOM interface, and exposes it to
any ADSI-compliant client applications. For more information about
using ADSI with IIS, see <a href="prog_use_using.htm"><b>Using IIS Admin Objects</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
