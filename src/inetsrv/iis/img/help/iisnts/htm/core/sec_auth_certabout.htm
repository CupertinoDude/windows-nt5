<h1>About Certificates</h1><a name="H1_37676752"></a><p>Certificates contain information used in establishing identities
over a network, a process called authentication. Similar to
conventional forms of identification, certificates enable Web
servers and users to authenticate each other before establishing a
connection. Certificates also contain encryption values, or <i>
keys</i>, that are used in establishing a Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) connection between the client and server. Information, such
as a credit card number, sent over this connection is encrypted so
that it cannot be intercepted and used by unauthorized parties.</p><p>There are two types of certificates used in SSL, each with its
own format and purpose. <i>Client certificates</i> contain personal
information about the clients requesting access to your site that
allows you to positively identify them before allowing them access
to the site. <i>Server certificates</i> contain information about
the server that allows the client to positively identify the server
before sharing sensitive information.</p><ul><li><a href="sec_auth_certabout.htm#server"><b>Server

you must obtain and install a valid server certificate. Server
certificates are digital identifications containing information
about your Web server and the organization sponsoring the server's
Web content. A server certificate enables users to authenticate
your server, check the validity of Web content, and establish a
secure connection. The server certificate also contains a <i>public
key</i>, which is used in creating a secure connection between the
client and server.</p><p>The success of a server certificate as a means of identification
depends on whether the user trusts the validity of information
contained in the certificate. For example, a user logging on to
your company's Web site might be hesitant to provide credit card
information, despite having viewed the contents of your company's
server certificate. This may be especially true if your company is
new and not well known.</p><p>For this reason, certificates are sometimes issued and endorsed
by a mutually trusted, third-party organization, called a <a href="sec_auth_certabout.htm#H2_20495411"><b>certification
authority</b></a> (CA). The certification authority's primary
responsibility is confirming the identity of those seeking a
certificate, thus ensuring the validity of the identification
information contained in the certificate.</p><p>Alternatively, depending on your organization's relationship
with its Web site users, you can issue your own server
certificates. For example, in the case of a large corporate
intranet handling employee payroll and benefits information,
corporate management may decide to maintain a certificate server,
and assume responsibility for validating identification information
and issuing server certificates. For more information see <a href="sec_auth_certobtainsrv.htm"><b>Obtaining a Server Certificate</b></a>.</p><h4><a name="H2_448415275"></a>Server-Gated Cryptography</h4><p>Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC) offers financial institutions the solution for worldwide secure financial transactions using 128-bit encryption. SGC is an extension of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) that allows financial institutions with export versions of IIS to use strong encryption.</p><p>Server-Gated Cryptography does not require an application running on the client's browser and can be utilized by standard export versions of IIS, version 4.0 or later. A server configured for SGC can facilitate both 128-bit and 40-bit encryption sessions, so multiple versions of IIS are not required. Although SGC capabilities are built into IIS 4.0 and later versions, a special SGC certificate is required to use SGC. Contact your certification authority for availability information. For more information about SGC, see the article titled <b>Secured online banking goes global!</b> at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&amp;sbp=sgc&amp;pver=1.0&amp;ar=security" target="_New"><b>Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC)</b></a> Web site.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you open your SGC certificate, you might receive a notice on the <b>General</b> tab saying, "The certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes." This notice is issued because of the way SGC certificates interact with Windows 2000 and does not necessarily indicate that the certificate does not work properly.</p>
<h4><a name="H2_4484152755"></a>Selectable Cryptographic Service Provider</h4><p>Selectable Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) allows you to select a Microsoft or third party cryptographic provider to handle cryptography and certificate management. Each cryptographic provider can create a public and private key to encrypt data sent to and from the Web server.  The private key is stored at the server end on hardware, on a PCI card, on a SmartCard, or in the registry as it is for the two default providers that Microsoft installs: Microsoft DH SChannel Cryptographic Provider and Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider. The Microsoft Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI) for every provider contains identical methods and properties.  This allows for switching between providers without having to rewrite code. For more information on CSP and managing installed third-party cryptographic providers, see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/c-frame.htm?/workshop/security/capi/cryptapi.asp" target="_New"><b>Microsoft CryptoAPI Overview</b></a> on MSDN's Web Workshop.

Certificates</a></h2><p>Client certificates are electronic documents that contain
information about clients. These certificates, like server
certificates, contain not only this information but also encryption
keys that form part of the SSL 3.0 security features of IIS.
These keys, or encryption codes, from the server and the client
certificates form a <i>key pair</i> that facilitate encryption and
decryption of transmitted data over an open network, such as the
Internet. For more information on encryption see <a href="sec_encryp_aboutencryp.htm"><b>About Encryption</b></a>.</p><p>The typical client certificate contains several items of
information: the identity of the user, the identity of the
certification authority, a <i>public key</i> used for establishing
secure communications, and validation information, such as an
expiration date and serial number. Certification authorities offer
different types of client certificates, containing differing
amounts of information, depending on the level of authentication
required. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_certobtaincli.htm"><b>Obtaining a Client Certificate</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="H2_20495411">Certification
Authorities</a></h2><p>You can obtain a client certificate from a mutually trusted,
commercial organization called a <i>certification authority</i>.
Before issuing a certificate, the authority requires you to provide
identification information, such as a name, address, and
organization name. The extent of this information can vary with the
identification assurance requirements of the certificate. If you
need a certificate to provide absolute assurance about your
identity, then the certification authority will require substantial
information from you; gathering this information may require a
personal interview with the authority and the endorsement of a
notary.</p><p>For a list of certificate authorities, see <a href="sec_auth_certobtainsrv.htm"><b>Obtaining a Server Certificate</b></a>.</p><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Ultimately, the success of certificate
authentication depends on whether the party receiving a certificate
trusts the authority who issued the certificate, and that the
authority properly verified the certificate owner's identity. But
beyond this trust, certificates do not provide conclusive proof
about the identity, trustworthiness, or intentions, of the user or
server.</p>
<h2><a name="ctl">Certificate Trust Lists</a></h2><p>By maintaining a certificate trust list (CTL), Web site
administrators can automatically verify client certificates against
a predefined list of trusted certificate authorities.</p><p>For example, an intranet administrator might create a different
list of trusted certificate authorities for each department on the
network. IIS would only accept client certificates supplied by
certificate authorities in the CTL for that department. For more
information, see <a href="sec_auth_certtrustlists.htm"><b>Using Certificate Trust Lists</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="H2_37679028">Detection of Revoked
Client Certificates</a></h2><p>Most reputable certificate authorities maintain a certificate
revocation list (CRL), which is a list of current client
certificates revoked before their scheduled expiration dates.</p><p>For example, if a certification authority issues a client
certificate to a user and later determines that the user submitted
false information, the authority can revoke that user's client
certificate. However, because the certification authority cannot
physically revoke a client certificate, the authority alerts Web
administrators by adding information about the revoked client
certificate to a CRL. For more information about revocation service
providers, contact your certification authority.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
