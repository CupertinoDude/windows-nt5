<h1>Integrated Windows Authentication</h1><a name="H1_37675702"></a><p>Integrated Windows authentication (formerly called NTLM, also
referred to as Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication)
is a secure form of authentication because the user name and
password are hashed before being sent across the network. When you
enable Integrated Windows authentication, the user's browser proves
its knowledge of the password through a cryptographic exchange with
your Web server, involving hashing.</p><p>Integrated Windows authentication uses Kerberos v5
authentication and NTLM authentication. If Active Directory
Services is installed on a Windows 2000 or higher domain controller
and the user's browser supports the Kerberos v5 authentication
protocol, Kerberos v5 authentication is used; otherwise, NTLM
authentication is used.</p><p>The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is a feature of the
Windows 2000 Distributed Services architecture. For
Kerberos v5 authentication to be successful, both the client
and the server must have a trusted connection to a Key Distribution
Center (KDC) and be Directory Services compatible. For more
information about Kerberos and NTLM, see the Windows Whistler
online documentation.</p><h3>Integrated Windows Authentication Process</h3>

The following steps outline how a client is authenticated using
Integrated Windows authentication: 

<ol><li>Unlike Basic authentication, Integrated Windows authentication
does not initially prompt for a user name and password. The current
Windows user information on the client computer is used for
Integrated Windows authentication.</li><li><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Internet Explorer versions 4.0 and later can
be configured to initially prompt for user information if needed.
For more information, see the Internet Explorer documentation.</p>
</li><li>If the authentication exchange initially fails to identify the
user, the browser prompts the user for a Windows user account user
name and password, which it processes by using Integrated Windows
authentication.</li><li>Internet Explorer continues to prompt the user until the user
either enters a valid user name and password or closes the prompt
dialog box.</li></ol><p>Although Integrated Windows authentication is secure, it does
have two limitations:</p><ol><li>Only Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0 and later
support this authentication method.</li><li>Integrated Windows authentication does not work over HTTP Proxy
connections.</li></ol><p>Therefore, Integrated Windows authentication is best suited for
an intranet environment, where both user and Web server computers
are in the same domain and where administrators can ensure that
every user has Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0 or
later.</p><h2><a name="ssl">Certificate Authentication</a></h2><p>You can also use your Web server's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
security features for two types of authentication. You can use a
<i>server certificate</i> to allow users to authenticate your Web
site before they transmit personal information, such as a credit
card number. Also, you can use <i>client certificates</i> to
authenticate users requesting information on your Web site. SSL
authenticates by checking the contents of an encrypted digital
identification submitted by the user's Web browser during the logon
process. (Users obtain client certificates from a mutually trusted
third-party organization.) Server certificates usually contain
information about your company and the organization that issued the
certificate. Client certificates usually contain identifying
information about the user and the organization that issued the
certificate. For more information, see <a href="sec_auth_certabout.htm"><b>About Certificates</b></a>.</p><h3><a name="H4_37683048">Client Certificate
Mapping</a></h3><p>Because a Windows user account is required to access resources
like files, you can associate, or <i>map</i>, client certificates
to Windows user accounts on your Web server. After you create and
enable a certificate map, each time a user logs on with a client
certificate, your Web server automatically associates that user to
the appropriate Windows user account. This way, you can
automatically authenticate users who log on with client
certificates, without requiring the use of either Basic, Digest, or
Integrated Windows authentication. You can map either one client
certificate to one Windows user account or many client certificates
to one account. For example, if you had several different
departments or businesses on your server, each with its own Web
site, you could use many-to-one mapping to map all of the client
certificates of each department or company to its own Web site.
This way, each site provides access only to its own clients. For
more information, see <a href="sec_auth_mapclient.htm"><b>Mapping Client Certificates to User Accounts</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="enableNTLM">Configuring Integrated
Windows Authentication</a></h2><p>Only Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0 or later
support Integrated Windows authentication. Integrated Windows
authentication does not work across proxy servers or other firewall
applications. If Integrated Windows authentication fails, due to
improper user credentials or some other problem, the browser
prompts the user to enter their user name and password.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
