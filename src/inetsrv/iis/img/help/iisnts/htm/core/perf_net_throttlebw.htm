<h1>Throttling Bandwidth</h1><p>If the network 

or Internet connection
used by your Web server is also used by other services such as
e-mail 

or news, you may want
to limit the bandwidth used by your Web server so bandwidth is
available for the other services. 

If you are running more than one Web
site, you can individually throttle the bandwidth used by each
site. You can throttle only the bandwidth used by
static HTML files. 

If you are using socket pooling,
throttling the bandwidth on one site also throttles all other sites
sharing that IP address. Socket pooling is enabled by default. For
more information about disabling socket pooling, see <a href="perf_mem_aboutmemory.htm#BalancingMemoryUse"><b>Balancing Memory
Use Against Response Speed</b></a> in About Memory
Management.</p><p><b>To determine how much bandwidth your server is using</b></p><ol><li>Use System Monitor to examine the Bytes Total/sec or Current
Bandwidth counter in the Network Interface object. (If you want to
compare incoming and outgoing traffic, you can examine both Bytes
Sent/sec and Bytes Received/sec.)</li><li>Compare the values with the total bandwidth of your network
connection. With a normal load, your server should not use more
than 50 percent of its total available bandwidth. If your server is
subject to large peaks or extreme spikes, it's a good idea to keep
the normal load even lower than 50 percent. The remaining
"headroom" bandwidth is used during peak periods.</li></ol><p><b>To throttle the bandwidth used by IIS</b></p><ol><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select the
