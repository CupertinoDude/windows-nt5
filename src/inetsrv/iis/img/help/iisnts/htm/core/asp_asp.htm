<h1>Getting Started with ASP</h1><p>Microsoft® Active Server Pages (ASP) is a server-side
scripting environment that you can use to create dynamic and
interactive Web pages, and build powerful Web applications. When
the server receives a request for an ASP file, it processes
server-side script code contained in the file to build the HTML Web
page that is sent to the browser. In addition to server-side script
code, ASP files can contain HTML (including related client-side
scripts) as well as calls to COM components that perform a variety
of tasks, such as connecting to a database or processing business
logic.</p><p>The topics in this section introduce Active Server Pages,
explain the basic concepts of scripting with Active Server Pages,
and discuss more complex application issues such as how to maintain
state.</p><p>This section contains:</p><ul><li><b><a href="asp_und_introtohtm.htm"><b>Overview of HTML</b></a></b>: Provides an introduction for beginner HTML writers.
