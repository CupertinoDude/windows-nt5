<h2>Process Demand Start</h2><p>Worker processes can be configured to automatically start when
the first request for a URL in a particular part of the namespace
group arrives at the server. This is possible because the namespace
group is owned by the application pool.</p><p>When a HTTP request arrives at the IIS server targeted to a URL
and no processes are available to handle it, the kernel-mode driver
notifies the process manager, WAS. WAS then queues the request,
along with any subsequent requests for that application pool in the
interim while the process is starting. Meanwhile the process
manager launches a worker process for that application pool. The
process initializes, and calls the kernel-mode driver to inform it
that the process is ready to receive requests and requests are now
routed. WAS manages demand process starting, and controls and
monitors the lifecycle of worker processes.</p><p>If the namespace group was configured as a Web garden, and there
are requests for it backing up in its kernel queue, then WAS starts
another process, using the same mechanism as with an application
pool.</p><p>The benefit is that the HTTP request will either be accepted
immediately (if the process is running), or be cached as it waits
in the queue for a new process to initialize, minimizing any delay
or interruption of service.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
