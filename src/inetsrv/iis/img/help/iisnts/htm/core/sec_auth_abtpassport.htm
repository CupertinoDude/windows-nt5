<h1>About Passport Authentication</h1><p>Microsoft Passport is an online user-authentication service.
Passport lets a consumer create a single sign-in name and password
for easy, secure access to all Passport-enabled Web sites and
services. Passport-enabled sites (also called participating sites)
rely on Passport to authenticate users rather than hosting and
maintaining their own proprietary authentication systems. However,
Passport does not authorize or deny a specific user's access to
individual participating sites; Web sites that implement Passport
maintain control over permissions.</p><p>Passport users can also store personal information in secure
"profiles" on Passport's servers. When a Passport user registers at
a participating site, this personal information can be shared with
the site to speed registration. When the Passport user signs in at
that site again, their Passport profile can enable access to
personalized accounts or services at that site.</p><p>Passport's authentication features also make it a foundation
service of Microsoft's emerging .NET platform. The ability to
identify and authenticate a unique Internet user, in order to
connect that user securely to his or her information and Web
services anywhere, using any Web device, is fundamental to the .NET
goal of secure, distributed computing between the Internet and
client environments. Passport and .NET will help users unlock the
Internet's full potential by letting them control their information
and personalize their Web experience to an extent never before
possible. And as a .NET foundation service, Passport will save
businesses time and money by relieving developers of the need to
build proprietary customer-authentication systems. Developers can
concentrate instead on their sites' own value-added features.</p><div><p><b>Related Topics</b></p><ul><li>For more information about implementing Passport with IIS, see
