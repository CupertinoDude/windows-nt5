<h1>Mapping Client Certificates to User Accounts</h1><a name="H1_37709492"></a><p>You can authenticate users who log on with a client certificate
by creating <i>mappings</i> that relate the information contained
in the certificate to a Windows user account. There are two ways to
map certificates: <a href="#H2_448402558"><b>one-to-one</b></a> and <a href="#H2_448402922"><b>many-to-one</b></a>. You can use the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a> for both mapping types.</p><ul><li><a href="#aboutmap"><b>About Mapping</b></a></li><li><a href="#mappingstratagies"><b>Mapping Strategies</b></a></li><li><a href="#exportingmap"><b>Exporting a Certificate</b></a></li><li><a href="#mapping"><b>How To Map Certificates</b></a></li></ul><ul><li>A server certificate must be installed in order for certificate
mapping to be enabled. For more information on installing a server
certificate, see <a href="sec_auth_certobtainsrv.htm"><b>Obtaining a Server Certificate</b></a>.</li><li>To ensure that changes to mapping rules are enacted, you must
stop and restart your Web site. To do this: In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select the Web site and
either select <b>Stop</b> from the <b>Action</b> menu, or click the
<b>Stop</b> icon on the tool bar. Then select <b>Start</b> from the
<b>Action</b> menu, or click the <b>Start</b> icon on the tool
bar.</li></ul><h2><a name="aboutmap"></a>About Mapping</h2><h3><a name="H2_448402558"></a>One-to-One
mapping</h3><p>One-to-one mapping maps individual client certificates to
accounts. The server compares the copy of the client certificate it
holds with the client certificate sent by the browser. The two must
be absolutely identical for the mapping to proceed. If a client
gets another certificate containing all of the same user
information, it must be mapped again.</p><h3><a name="H2_448402922"></a>Many-to-One
mapping</h3><p>Many-to-one mapping uses <i>wildcard</i> matching rules that
verify whether a client certificate contains specific information,
such as issuer or subject. This mapping does not compare the actual
client certificate, but rather accepts all client certificates
fulfilling the specific criteria. If a client gets another
certificate containing all of the same user information, the
existing mapping will work.</p><h3>Directory Service (DS) mapping</h3><p>Directory Service (DS) certificate mapping uses native
Windows 2000 Active Directory features to authenticate users
with client certificates. There are both advantages and
disadvantages to using DS mapping. For example, and advantage is
that the client certificate information is shared across many
servers. A disadvantage is that wildcard matching is not as
advanced as in the IIS mapper. For more information about DS
mapping, see the Windows 2000 documentation.</p><p>You can enable DS mapping only at the Master properties level,
and only if you are a member of a Windows 2000 domain.
Activating DS mapping will exclude the use of one-to-one and
many-to-one mapping for the entire Web service.</p><a name="mappingstratagies"></a><h2><a name="H2_448403756"></a>Mapping
Strategies</h2><p>Client certificate mapping is very flexible in that any of the
three mapping methods can be used to map client certificates to
user accounts. You can a map client certificate to any number of
user accounts and any number of client certificates to a single
user account. Certificate mapping can be used in several
situations, including:</p><ul><li><b>Large Networks</b> Networks with a large number of
client certificates might use many-to-one or DS mapping. The
administrator could create one or more matching rules to map
certificates to one or more Windows user accounts.</li><li><b>Small Networks</b> Networks with very few users could
use one-to-one mapping to provide greater control of certificate
usage and revocation, or many-to-one mapping to facilitate easier
administration.</li><li><b>Additional Security</b> For resources that have few
users and require additional security, the administrator might use
one-to-one mapping. In this way, the administrator could be sure
that only particular certificates are used. This allows better
certificate revocation policies to be enforced.</li><li><b>Internet</b> Internet sites that use certificate
authentication could use many-to-one mapping by accepting a wide
range of certificates and mapping them all to an account with
rights similar to the IUSR_<i>computername</i> account.</li><li><b>By Certification Authority</b> To map all users who log
on with client certificate issued by a particular organization, you
could use many-to-one mapping and define a matching rule that
automatically maps any certificate issued by that organization to a
user account.</li></ul><p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you require the flexibility of wildcard mapping,
use the IIS mapping feature. If you are using mapping to integrate
your Web sites into a Windows domain, the Windows DS mapper might
be better suit your purpose. For more information, see the Windows
documentation.</p>
<h2><a name="exportingmap"></a>Exporting a
Certificate</h2><p>Some certificates need to be <i>exported</i> for use in IIS
one-to-one mapping. Certificates do not need to be exported for use
in many-to-one mapping. Contact your certification authority for
more information.</p><h6>To export a certificate using Internet Explorer,
version 4.0 or later</h6><p>You can also use this procedure to create a backup copy of your
certificate.</p><ol><li>In Internet Explorer, click <b>View</b> and then <b>Internet
Options</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Internet Options</b> property sheets, click <b>
Contents</b>.</li><li>On the <b>Contents</b> property sheet click either <b>
Personal</b> (Internet Explorer version 4.0) or <b>
Certificates</b> and then the <b>Personal</b> tab (Internet
Explorer version 5).</li><li>Select the certificate from the list and click <b>
Export</b>.</li><li>In the wizard, select <b>Next</b> and then select <b>No, do not
include any private keys in the export</b> and click <b>
Next.</b></li><li>On the next page, select <b>Base64 Encoded X.509 (*.CER)</b>
and click <b>Next</b>. Complete the procedure as outlined in the
wizard. 

<p>The certificate is now ready for any subsequent IIS one-to-one
mapping. This procedure needs to be done only once for each
certificate.</p></li></ol><h2><a name="mapping"></a>How To Map Certificates</h2><p>One-to-one mapping maps individual client certificates to
accounts. Many-to-one mapping uses <i>wildcard</i> matching rules
that verify whether a client certificate contains specific
information, such as issuer or subject.</p><a name="OnetoOnemap"></a><h6>To map a specific client certificate to a user account
(one-to-one mapping)</h6><ol><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select the
Web site you want to configure authentication for, and open its
property sheets.</li><li>On the <b>Directory Security</b> property sheet, under <b>
Secure Communications</b>, click <b>Edit</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Secure Communications</b> dialog box, select the <b>
Enable client certificate mapping</b> check box if not already
selected. Click <b>Edit</b>.</li><li>On the <b>1-to-1</b> tab of the <b>Account Mappings</b> dialog
box, either add a new certificate by clicking <b>Add</b>, or edit
an existing mapping by selecting the mapping and clicking <b>Edit
Map</b>.</li><li>If you are adding a new certificate, browse to the certificate
file and open it. 

<p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If you cannot find the certificate file, then it
might need to be exported.</p>
</li><li>In the <b>Map to Account</b> dialog box, enter a map name for
the mapping. This is the name that will be displayed in the
selection list on the <b>Account Mappings</b> dialog box.</li><li>Either type or browse to a Windows user account. Type the
password of the account that the certificate is mapping to.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li><li>Repeat these steps to map other certificates or to map this
certificate to other accounts.</li></ol><a name="manymap"></a><h6>To add a client certificate mapping using wildcard rules

This is the name that will be displayed in the selection list on
the <b>Account Mappings</b> dialog box. You can create rules for
future use or disable rules without deleting them by selecting or
clearing the <b>Enable this wildcard rule</b> check box. Click <b>
Next</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Rules</b> dialog box, click <b>New</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Edit Rule Element</b> dialog box, select the
appropriate criteria and click <b>OK</b>. 

<p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>Steps 6 and 7 can be repeated to define the rule
more stringently.</p>
</li><li>When finished, click <b>Next</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Mapping</b> dialog box, either type or browse to a
Windows user account. Type the password of the account that the
rule is mapping to. 

<p><img src="note.gif" alt="note"><b>
      Note
      </b>If the account you are mapping to is on a computer
that is a member of a workgroup, you will need to specify the
computer name and the account name. For example, if you are mapping
to the RegionalSales account on the computer called Sales1, the
mapping account name would be Sales1\RegionalSales.</p>
</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li><li>Repeat these steps to create other mapping rules.</li><li>Use the <b>Move Up</b> and <b>Move Down</b> buttons to
establish the precedence given to the rules. Rules higher in the
list take precedence.</li></ol><h6>To edit an existing wildcard rule (many-to-one mapping)</h6><ol><li>In the <a href="gs_iissnapin.htm"><b>IIS snap-in</b></a>, select the
Web site you want to configure authentication for, and open its
property sheets.</li><li>On the <b>Directory Security</b> property sheet, click <b>
Edit</b> under <b>Secure Communications</b>.</li><li>In the <b>Secure Communications</b> dialog box, select the <b>
Enable client certificate mapping</b> check box, if not already
selected. Click <b>Edit</b>.</li><li>On the <b>Many-to-one</b> tab of the <b>Account Mappings</b>
dialog box, select the rule and click <b>Edit Rule</b>.</li><li>Make necessary changes.</li><li>When finished, click <b>OK</b>.</li></ol><p> </p><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li>Specific client certificate mappings always take precedence
over wildcard mappings.</li><li>Some client certificates offer a greater amount of
identification information and may contain additional, custom
subfields. For information about certificate formats, see your
certification authority.</li><li>Use matching rules that are as specific as possible. A good
wildcard rule matches information from several different fields and
subfields. For example, the names Accounting, Shipping, and Sales
can appear in the organization unit subfield of more than one
company's client certificate. A matching rule that mapped
certificates based exclusively on this subfield would probably
result in unintended mappings.</li></ul><hr class="iis" size="1">
