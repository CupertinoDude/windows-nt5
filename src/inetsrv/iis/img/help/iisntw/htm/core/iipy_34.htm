<p><strong>App Mappings Property Sheet</strong></p>

<p>Use this property sheet to map file name extensions to the program or interpreter that processes those files. Mapped applications include Internet Server API (ISAPI) applications, Active Server Pages (ASP) applications, Internet Database Connector (IDC) applications, and files that use server-side include directives. For example, when the Web server receives a request for a page with an .asp file name extension, it uses the application mapping to determine that the executable file asp.dll should be called to process the page.</p>

<p><strong>Cache ISAPI Applications</strong></p>

<p>Internet Server API DLLs can be loaded and cached so that further requests can be processed without calling the application again. Most ISAPI applications (including Active Server Pages) benefit from caching.  You should clear this option only for special circumstances, such as debugging ISAPI applications.</p>

<p>If the same ISAPI application has been loaded and cached by more than one Web site on a server, then clearing this option for the server does not unload the application from memory. You must clear this option for all Web sites that use the application. Clearing this option does not unload running applications. Only subsequent requests are not cached.</p>

<p><strong>Application Mappings</strong></p>

<p>The table lists the file name extension associated with an executable file and the name of the executable file. If the word "(all)" appears in the list, all verbs will be sent to the application; "(all)" is not a verb.</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>Important</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the App Mappings property sheet for IIS&nbsp;4.0, there was a list of verbs in the <strong>Exclusions</strong> column. For IIS&nbsp;5.0 and 5.1, this has changed to a <strong>Verbs</strong> column which lists the HTTP verbs that will be run by the application.</p> 

<p><strong>To add an application mapping</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the extension for the executable file in the <strong>Ext</strong> column.</li>
<li>Enter the physical path to the executable file in the <strong>Executable Path</strong> column.</li>
<li>Enter the HTTP Verbs that the executable file should pass to the application. To specify that all verbs should be passed to the application, leave this field blank (the field will be populated with the term "(All)" when you click <strong>OK</strong>). Separate method names with a comma (,).</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Script Engine</strong> check box if you want the application to run in a directory without Execute permissions.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Check for File</strong> check box to instruct the Web server to verify the existence of the requested script file and to ensure that the requesting user has access permission for that script file.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To remove an application mapping, select the extension and click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Script Engine</strong> setting is intended primarily for script-based applications such as ASP and IDC that are mapped to an interpreter. For a script-mapped application to run, either the <strong>Script</strong> or <strong>Execute</strong> access check box must be selected for the directory in which the application is located. To allow only script-mapped applications to run, use the <strong>Script</strong> access. To allow both script-mapped applications and executable files (.exe and .dll) to run, use the <strong>Execute</strong> access.</li>

<li>If you select the <strong>Check for File</strong> check box and the script does not exist or the user does not have access permission for the script file, the appropriate warning message is returned to the browser and the script engine is not invoked. This option can be useful for scripts mapped to non-CGI executables like the Perl interpreter that do not send a CGI response if the script is not accessible. Because the script will be opened twice, once by the server and once by the script engine, there is some performance cost to enabling this option.</li>
