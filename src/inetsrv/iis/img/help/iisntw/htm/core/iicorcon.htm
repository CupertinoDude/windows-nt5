<H1><A name=H1_448394830></A>Managing Connections to a Remote Share</H1>

<P>If your Web site connects virtual directories to 
shares on a remote computer running Windows 2000 or later, IIS uses Server Message 
Block (SMB) work-contexts to&nbsp;detect directory change notifications on the remote 
computer. IIS&nbsp;listens for change notifications&nbsp;in order to purge files 
in the ASP template cache and the IIS static file cache and to replace them with 
fresh data from the changed files on the remote share.&nbsp;If these caches are not turned on, IIS must retrieve content from the remote share, and for ASP pages, compile any scripts they contain for every user request. These are expensive processes.

<p>By default, Windows XP accepts requests to 50 SMB work contexts but you can establish a maximum of 2048 SMB worker contexts. Because the remote computer restricts the number of SMB work contexts it accepts, automatic updates to cached files can fail. The following errors are symptoms that SMB calls are failing:
<ul>
<li>RPC 1792 - The remote procedure call failed and did not execute.
<li>Netlogon 5719 - Unable to find domain controller.</ul>

<p>When SMB calls fail, IIS continues to serve unchanged, outdated ASP scripts from the ASP template cache and outdated static pages from the IIS static file cache. In these cases, refreshing the caches requires restarting IIS. You can manage problems associated with connections to remote shares in the following ways:</P>
<ul>
  <li><A href="#structuring">Structuring Virtual Directories</a>
  <li><A href="#moving">  Moving the Content</a>
  <li><A href="#raising">Raising the Connection Limit on the Remote Server</a>
  <li><A href="#turning">Turning Off ASP Template Caching</a></ul>

<h2><a name="structuring">Structuring Virtual Directories</a></h2>
<p>If you need to create thousands of virtual directories that acquire data from a single remote computer, build a deep virtual directory tree, rather than a wide one. IIS can monitor changes within subdirectories of high-level virtual directories. For example, if you need data from 2500 virtual directories that access a single remote server, you can create 25 top-level virtual directories with 100 subdirectories each. This creates a virtual directory tree with fewer remote connections than the Windows
XP default limit of 50 per client.
</p>
<h2><a name="moving">Moving the Content</a></h2>
<p>You can resolve the problem of connection limits for both dynamic data and static file data by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributing the content to a greater number of remote servers, or,
<li>Moving some or all of the data to the local server.</ul>
<p>Distributing your content between two or more remote servers may solve the problem without requiring any restructuring of your site's virtual directories. For example, suppose you are connecting 3000 virtual directories for your site to one remote server. If you move half the content to a second remote server, you can connect half the virtual directories to the second remote server and reduce the number of connections to each remote server to 1500.</p>

<p>You can achieve similar benefits if you store some of the content locally, reducing the total number of procedure calls required. By moving or replicating all the content to the local server, you eliminate the problems associated with managing connections to remote shares and remove the need to listen for UNC directory changes.</p>

<h2><a name="raising"></a>Raising the Connection Limit on the Remote Server</h2>
<p>You may solve the problem of connection limits by raising the connection limit on the remote computer to the maximum of 2048 connections per client. Then, your site can establish more simultaneous connections to the server. </p>
<p>Maximizing the number of connections that the server requires setting two keys in the registry:</p>
<UL>
  <li>Use the following path in the registry:
  <br><br> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters<br><br>

  <LI>Set <strong>MaxMpxCt</strong> to 2048. This registry key specifies a suggested maximum number of simultaneous requests that the server accepts per client. IIS acts as a client when it requests data from a remote server.
  <LI>Set <strong>MaxWorkItems</strong> to 8192. This registry key specifies the maximum number of receive buffers, also called work items, the server can allocate. When this number is reached, the server must initiate flow control, which reduces performance. <strong>MaxWorkItems</strong> should be at least four times the setting for <strong>MaxMpxCt</strong>.</LI></UL>
<p>For information on changing the registry, see "Add and Delete Information in the Registry Editor" and "Edit Registry Data" in the Help topics for RegEdt32.exe.</p>

<H2><a name="turning">Turning Off ASP Template Caching</a></h2>
<P>If you cannot effectively resolve the connection limit problem using one of the solutions above, you can turn off the ASP template cache, the IIS static file cache, or both, reducing or removing the need to connect to the remote server to listen for changes. However, this slows the delivery of pages to clients and can result in performance that is unacceptably poor.</P>

<p><b>To turn off the ASP template cache:</b></P>
<ol>
<li>In the <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a>, select the Web site or the starting point directory of the isolated application.
<li>Open the directory's property sheets, and click the <strong>Configuration</strong> button in the Application Settings section. If the <b>Configuration</b> button is not active, the directory or starting point does not contain an isolated application. You can create a new application by clicking the <b>Create</b> button.</p>

<li>Click the <strong>Cache Options</strong> tab. If the <strong>Cache Options</strong> tab is not available, make certain Application Protection in the Application Settings section is set to <i>High (Isolated)</i>. If you change the Application Protection to <i>High (Isolated)</i>, you must click <b>Apply</b> for the changes to take effect.</p>

<li>Under <strong>ASP File Cache</strong>, select <strong>Do not cache ASP files</strong>.
<li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Restart IIS.</li></ol>

<p><b>To turn off the IIS file cache:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>   Use&nbsp;the following registry path:<br><br> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters<br><br>

  <li>Set&nbsp;<STRONG>DisableMemoryCache</STRONG> to 1.
  <li>Restart IIS.</li></ol>
