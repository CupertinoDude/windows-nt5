<h1><a name="H1_37709492">Mapping Client Certificates to User Accounts</a></h1>

<p>You can authenticate users who log on with a client certificate by creating <em>mappings</em> that relate the information contained in the certificate to a Windows user account. There are two ways to map certificates: <a href="#H2_448402558">one-to-one</a> and <a href="#H2_448402922">many-to-one</a>. You can use the <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a> for both mapping types.</P>

<li><a href="#mapping">How To Map Certificates</a></li>
</ul>

<P><strong><font color="#0000FF">Important</font></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A server certificate must be installed in order for certificate mapping to be enabled. For more information on installing a server certificate, see <A HREF="iiocrsc.htm">Obtaining a Server Certificate</A>.</li>
<li>To ensure that changes to mapping rules are enacted, you must stop and restart your Web site. To do this:
In the <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a>, select the Web site and either select <strong>Stop</strong> from the <strong>Action</strong> menu, or click the <strong>Stop</strong> icon on the tool bar. Then select <strong>Start</strong> from the <strong>Action</strong> menu, or click the <strong>Start</strong> icon on the tool bar.</li>

<H2><A NAME="aboutmap"></A>About Mapping</H2>

<H3><A NAME="H2_448402558"></A>One-to-One mapping</H3>
<P>One-to-one mapping maps individual client certificates to accounts. The server compares the copy of the client certificate it holds with the client certificate sent by the browser. The two must be absolutely identical for the mapping to proceed. If a client gets another certificate containing all of the same user information, it must be mapped again.</P>

<H3><A NAME="H2_448402922"></A>Many-to-One mapping</H3>
<P>Many-to-one mapping uses <em>wildcard</em> matching rules that verify whether a client certificate contains specific information, such as issuer or subject. This mapping does not compare the actual client certificate, but rather accepts all client certificates fulfilling the specific criteria. If a client gets another certificate containing all of the same user information, the existing mapping will work.</P>

<H3>Directory Service (DS) mapping</H3>
<P>Directory Service (DS) certificate mapping uses native Windows Active Directory features to authenticate users with client certificates. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using DS mapping. For example, and advantage is that the client certificate information is shared across many servers. A disadvantage is that wildcard matching is not as advanced as in the IIS mapper. For more information about DS mapping, see the Windows documentation.</p>
<p>You can enable DS mapping only at the Master properties level, and only if you are a member of a Windows domain. Activating DS mapping will exclude the use of <nobr>one-to-one</nobr> and <nobr>many-to-one</nobr> mapping for the entire Web service.</P>


<a name="mappingstratagies"></a><H2><A NAME="H2_448403756"></A>Mapping Strategies</H2>
<P>Client certificate mapping is very flexible in that any of the three mapping methods can be used to map client certificates to user accounts. You can a map client certificate to any number of user accounts and any number of client certificates to a single user account. Certificate mapping can be used in several situations, including:</P>

<UL>
<LI><strong>Large Networks</strong>&nbsp;Networks with a large number of client certificates might use many-to-one or DS mapping. The administrator could create one or more matching rules to map certificates to one or more Windows user accounts.</LI>

<LI><strong>Small Networks</strong>&nbsp;Networks with very few users could use one-to-one mapping to provide greater control of certificate usage and revocation, or many-to-one mapping to facilitate easier administration.</LI>

<LI><strong>Additional Security</strong>&nbsp;For resources that have few users and require additional security, the administrator might use one-to-one mapping. In this way, the administrator could be sure that only particular certificates are used. This allows better certificate revocation policies to be enforced.</LI>

<LI><strong>Internet</strong>&nbsp;Internet sites that use certificate authentication could use many-to-one mapping by accepting a wide range of certificates and mapping them all to an account with rights similar to the IUSR_<EM>computername</EM> account.</LI>

<LI><strong>By Certification Authority</strong>&nbsp;To map all users who log on with client certificate issued by a particular organization, you could use many-to-one mapping and define a matching rule that automatically maps any certificate issued by that organization to a user account.</LI>
</UL>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you require the flexibility of wildcard mapping, use the IIS mapping feature. If you are using mapping to integrate your Web sites into a Windows domain, the Windows DS mapper might be better suit your purpose. For more information, see the Windows documentation.</p>


<h2><a name="exportingmap"></a>Exporting a Certificate</h2>
<p>Some certificates need to be <EM>exported</EM> for use in IIS one-to-one mapping. Certificates do not need to be exported for use in many-to-one mapping. Contact your certification authority for more information. </p>

<big>To export a certificate using Internet Explorer, version&nbsp;4.0 or later</big> 
<p>You can also use this procedure to create a backup copy of your certificate.</p>

<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, click <STRONG>View</STRONG> and then <STRONG>Internet Options</STRONG>.</LI>
<LI>In the <STRONG>Internet Options</STRONG> property sheets, click  <STRONG>Contents</STRONG>.</LI>
<LI>On the <STRONG>Contents</STRONG> property sheet click either <STRONG>Personal</STRONG> (Internet Explorer version&nbsp;4.0) or <STRONG>Certificates</STRONG> and then the <STRONG>Personal</STRONG> tab (Internet Explorer version&nbsp;5).</LI>
<LI>Select the certificate from the list and click <STRONG>Export</STRONG>.</LI>
<LI>In the wizard, select <STRONG>Next</STRONG> and then select <STRONG>No, do not include any private keys in the export</STRONG> and click <STRONG>Next.</STRONG></LI>
<LI>On the next page, select <STRONG>Base64 Encoded X.509 (*.CER)</STRONG> and click <STRONG>Next</STRONG>. Complete the procedure as outlined in the wizard.</LI>
<P>The certificate is now ready for any subsequent IIS one-to-one mapping. This procedure needs to be done only once for each certificate.</P>
</OL>


<H2><a name="mapping"></a>How To Map Certificates</H2>
<P>One-to-one mapping maps individual client certificates to accounts. Many-to-one mapping uses <EM>wildcard</EM> matching rules that verify whether a client certificate contains specific information, such as issuer or subject.</P>

<ol>
<LI>In the <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a>, select the Web site you want to configure authentication for, and open its property sheets.</LI>
<LI>On the <STRONG>Directory Security</STRONG> property sheet, under <STRONG>Secure Communications</STRONG>, click <STRONG>Edit</STRONG>.</LI>
<LI>In the <STRONG>Secure Communications</STRONG> dialog box, select the <STRONG>Enable client certificate mapping</STRONG> check box if not already selected. Click <STRONG>Edit</STRONG>.</LI>

<LI>If you are adding a new certificate, browse to the certificate file and open it.</LI>

<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot find the certificate file, then it might need to be exported.</P>

<LI>In the <STRONG>Map to Account</STRONG> dialog box, enter a map name for the mapping. This is the name that will be displayed in the selection list on the <STRONG>Account Mappings</STRONG> dialog box.</LI>
<LI>Either type or browse to a Windows user account. Type the password of the account that the certificate is mapping to.</LI>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Specific client certificate mappings always take precedence over wildcard mappings.</li>
<li>Some client certificates offer a greater amount of identification information and may contain additional, custom subfields. For information about certificate formats, see your certification authority.</li>
<li>Use matching rules that are as specific as possible. A good wildcard rule matches information from several different fields and subfields. For example, the names Accounting, Shipping, and Sales can appear in the organization unit subfield of more than one company's client certificate.  A matching rule that mapped certificates based exclusively on this subfield would probably result in unintended mappings.</li>
</ul>
