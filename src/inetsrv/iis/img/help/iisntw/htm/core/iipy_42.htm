<p><strong>Extended Logging Properties</strong></p>

<p>You can customize W3C Extended logging by choosing the fields to be recorded in the log. To limit log size, omit unneeded fields.</p> 

<p>The fields are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date</strong> The date on which the activity occurred.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> The time the activity occurred.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Extended Properties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Client IP Address</strong> The IP address of the client that accessed your server.</li>
<li><strong>User Name</strong> The name of the user who accessed your server.</li>
<li><strong>Service Name</strong> The Internet service that was running on the client computer.</li>
<li><strong>Server Name</strong> The name of the server on which the log entry was generated.</li>
<li><strong>Server IP</strong> The IP address of the server on which the log entry was generated.</li>
<li><strong>Server Port</strong> The port number the client is connected to.</li>
<li><strong>Method</strong> The action the client was trying to perform (for example, a GET command).</li>
<li><strong>URI Stem</strong> The resource accessed: for example, an HTML page, a CGI program, or a script.</li>
<li><strong>URI Query</strong> The query, if any, the client was trying to perform; that is, one or more search strings for which the client was seeking a match.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Status</strong> The status of the action, in HTTP terms.</li>
<li><strong>Win32 Status</strong> The status of the action, in terms used by Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Bytes Sent</strong> The number of bytes sent by the server.</li>
<li><strong>Bytes Received</strong> The number of bytes received by the server.</li>
<li><strong>Time Taken</strong> The length of time the action took.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol Version</strong> The protocol (HTTP, FTP) version used by the client. For HTTP this will be either HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 1.1.</li>
<li><strong>User Agent</strong> The browser used on the client.</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> The content of the cookie sent or received, if any.</li>
<li><strong>Referer</strong> The site on which the user clicked on a link that brought the user to this site.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CPU Accounting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Event</strong> The type of process that triggered the event, either CGI or out-of-process application. The type can be CGI, Application, or All.</li>
<li><strong>Process Type</strong> What event was triggered: Site-Stop, Site-Start, Site-Pause, Periodic-Log, Interval-Start, Interval-End, Interval-Change, Update, Eventlog-Limit, Priority-Limit, Process-Stop-Limit, Site-Pause-Limit, Eventlog-Limit-Reset, Priority-Limit-Reset, Process-Stop-Limit-Reset, or Site-Pause-Limit.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Site-Stop</strong> The Web site was stopped.</li> 
<li><strong>Site-Start</strong> The Web site was started or re-started.</li> 
<li><strong>Site-Pause</strong> The Web site was paused.</li> 
<li><strong>Periodic-Log</strong> This is a regularly defined log entry whose interval was specified by the administrator.</li> 
<li><strong>Reset Interval-Start</strong> The Reset Interval has begun.</li> 
<li><strong>Reset Interval-End</strong> The Reset Interval has been reached and reset.</li> 
<li><strong>Reset Interval-Change</strong> The Web site administrator changed the value for the Reset Interval.</li> 
<li><strong>Update</strong> One of these events happened: the log interval was changed, and interval event took place, the site either stopped started, or paused.</li> 
<li><strong>Eventlog-Limit</strong> An event log was made for the Web site because its CPU resource usage for CGI and out-of-process application reached the event log limit set by the administrator.</li> 
<li><strong>Priority-Limit</strong> The Web site had a CGI or out-of-process application set to low priority because it reached the low priority limit set by the administrator.</li> 
<li><strong>Process-Stop-Limit</strong> The Web site had a CGI or out-of-process application stopped because it reached the process stopping limit set by the administrator.</li> 
<li><strong>Site-Pause-Limit</strong> The Web site was paused because it had a CGI or out-of-process application reach the site pause limit set by the administrator.</li> 
<li><strong>Eventlog-Limit-Reset</strong> The Reset Interval was reached or the Eventlog-Limit was manually changed.</li> 
<li><strong>Priority-Limit-Reset</strong> The Reset Interval was reached or the Priority-Limit was manually changed.</li> 
<li><strong>Process-Stop-Limit-Reset</strong> The Reset Interval was reached or the Process-Stop-Limit was manually changed.</li> 
<li><strong>Site-Pause-Limit</strong> The Reset Interval was reached or the Site-Pause-Limit was manually reset.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>User Time</strong> The total accumulated User Mode processor time, in seconds, that the site has used during the current interval.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel Time</strong> The total accumulated Kernel Mode processor time, in seconds, that the site has used during the current interval.</li>
<li><strong>Page Faults</strong> The total number of memory references that resulted in memory page faults.</li>
<li><strong>Total Processes</strong> The total number of CGI and out-of-process applications created during the current interval.</li>
<li><strong>Active Processes</strong> The total number of CGI and out-of-process applications running when the log was recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Terminated Processes</strong> The total number of CGI and out-of-process applications stopped due to Process Throttling during the current interval.</li>
</ul>
