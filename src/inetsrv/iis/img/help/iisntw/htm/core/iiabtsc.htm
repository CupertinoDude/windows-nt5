<h2><A NAME="wizards"></A>The New Task Wizards</h2>
<p>IIS&nbsp;5.0 included three new security task wizards which are also available in IIS&nbsp;5.1. The Certificates Wizard makes obtaining and managing server certificates easier. The CTL Wizard makes creating and managing certificate trust lists easier. These two wizards replace the procedures previously used in IIS for these tasks. The Permissions Wizard makes setting permissions on directories and files easier. (Permissions can still be set by the procedures used in NTFS and earlier versions of IIS.)  For more information, see <a href="iikeysc.htm">Using the New Security Task Wizards</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="authenticationbasics">Authentication Overview</a></h2>
<p>Internet Information Services provides security features that are fully integrated with Windows. Six methods of authentication are supported so that you can confirm the identity of anyone requesting access to your Web sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anonymous authentication</strong> allows anyone access without asking for a user name or password.</li>

<li><strong>Basic authentication</strong> prompts the user for a user name and password, which are sent <em>unencrypted</em> over the network.</li>

<li><strong>Digest authentication</strong> operates much like Basic authentication except that the passwords are sent as a <em>hash</em> value. Digest authentication is available only on domains with a Windows&nbsp;2000 domain controller.</li>

<li><strong>Advanced Digest authentication</strong> 
Advanced Digest authentication is identical to Digest authentication, except that Advanced digest stores the client credentials as an MD5 hash in Active Directory on your Windows
  XP domain controller for improved security. 
</li>

<li><strong>Integrated Windows authentication</strong> uses hashing technology to identify your user without actually sending the password over the network.</li>
<li><strong>Certificates</strong> are digital credentials that can be used to establish a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. They can also be used for authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use these methods to grant access to public areas of your site, while preventing unauthorized access to your private files and directories. See <A HREF="iiathsc.htm">Authentication</A> to learn more about the different ways that you can use authentication on your Web server.</p>


<h2><A NAME="accesscontrolbasics"></A>Access Control Overview</h2>
<p>With NTFS access permissions, the foundation of your Web server's security, you can define the level of file and directory access granted to Windows users and groups. For example, if a business decides to publish its catalog on your Web server, you need to create a Windows user account for that business and then configure permissions for the specific Web site, directory, or file. The permissions should permit only the server administrator and the owner of the business to update the Web site's contents. Public users should be allowed to view the Web site, but cannot alter its contents. For more details about setting NTFS permissions, see <A HREF="iidfpsc.htm">Setting NTFS Permissions for a Directory or File</A>.</p>

<p>WebDAV is an extension of the HTTP 1.1 protocol that facilitates file and directory manipulation over an HTTP connection. Through the use of WebDAV &quot;verbs,&quot; or commands, properties can be added to and read from files and directories. Files and directories can also be remotely created, deleted, moved, or copied. Additional access control can be configured through both Web server permissions and NTFS. For more information, see <a href="iiacnsc.htm">About Access Control</a> or <A href="wcwbdav.htm">WebDAV Publishing</A>.</p>

<h2><A NAME="certificatesbasics"></A>Certificates Overview</h2>
<p>Certificates are digital identification documents that allow both servers and clients to authenticate each other. They are required for the server and client's browser to set up an SSL connection over which encrypted information can be sent. The certificate-based SSL features in IIS consist of a server certificate, a client certificate, and various digital keys. You can create these certificates with Microsoft Certificate Services or obtain them from a mutually trusted, third-party organization called a certification authority (CA). For more information on setting up certificates and keys, see <a href="iisslsc.htm">Setting Up SSL on Your Server</a>.</p>

<h3>Server Certificates</h3>
<p>Server certificates provide a way for users to confirm your Web site's identity. A server certificate contains detailed identification information, such as the name of the organization affiliated with the server content, the name of the organization that issued the certificate, and a <em>public key</em> used in establishing an encrypted connection. This information helps to assure users of the authenticity of Web server content and the integrity of the secure HTTP connection. For more information, see <a href="iiabcsc.htm">About Certificates</a>.</p>

<h3>Client Certificates</h3>
<p>With SSL, your Web server also has the option of authenticating users by checking the contents of their client certificates. A typical client certificate contains detailed identification information about a user and the organization that issued the certificate and a <em>public key</em>. You can use client certificate authentication, along with SSL encryption, to implement a highly secure method for verifying the identity of your users. For more information, see <a href="iiabcsc.htm">About Certificates</a>.</p>

<h2><A NAME="encryptionbasics"></A>Encryption Overview</h2>
<P>You can enable users to exchange private information with your server, such as credit card numbers or phone numbers, in a secure way by using encryption. Encryption "scrambles" the information before it is sent, and decryption "unscrambles" it after it is received. The foundation for this encryption in IIS is the SSL&nbsp;3.0 protocol, which provides a secure way of establishing an encrypted communication link with users. SSL confirms the authenticity of your Web site and, optionally, the identity of users accessing restricted Web sites.</P>

<p> Certificates include <em>keys</em> used in establishing an SSL secure connection. A <em>key</em> is a unique value used to authenticate the server and the client in establishing an SSL connection. A <em>public key</em> and a <em>private key</em> form an SSL <em>key pair</em>. Your Web server utilizes this key pair to negotiate a secure connection with the user's Web browser to determine the level of encryption required for securing communications.</p>

<p>For this type of connection, both your Web server and the user's browser must be equipped with compatible encryption and decryption capabilities. During the exchange, an encryption key, or <em>session</em> key, is created. Both your server and the Web browser use the session key to encrypt and decrypt transmitted information. The session key's degree of encryption, or <em>strength</em>, is measured in <em>bits</em>. The greater the number of bits comprising the session key, the greater the level of encryption and security. Although these greater encryption key strengths offer greater security, they also require more server resources to implement. Your Web server's session key is typically 40 bits long, but can be 128 bits long depending upon the level of security you require. For more information, see <a href="iiencsc.htm">Encryption</a>.</p>




<h2><A NAME="auditingbasics"></A>Auditing Overview</h2>
<P>You can use security auditing techniques to monitor a broad range of user and Web server security activity. It is recommended that you routinely audit your server configuration to detect areas where resources may be susceptible to unauthorized access and tampering. You can use the integrated Windows utilities, or the logging features built into IIS, or use Active Server Pages (ASP) applications to create your own auditing logs. For more information, see <a href="iiaudsc.htm">Auditing</a>. </P>


<h2><A NAME="standardsused"></A>Standards Implemented</h2>
<p>Many of the security features in IIS implement Internet community standards. These standards help to facilitate uniformity and cross-platform utilization of applications and information. Microsoft is committed to working with the Internet and computer communities both in assisting to structure good standards, but also in its implementation of those standards. For more information on the standards implemented by the IIS security features, follow the appropriate link in the following list:</p>

<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=1769" target="_blank">Fortezza</a>. The U.S. government security standard, commonly called Fortezza, is supported in IIS. This standard satisfies the Defense Message System security architecture with a cryptographic mechanism that provides message confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and access control to messages, components, and systems. These features are implemented both with server and browser software and with PCMCIA card hardware. Fortezza is a widely used security standard within the U.S. government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&sbp=Netscape&pver=1.0&ar=SSL3" target="_blank">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL&nbsp;3.0)</a>
is a public key-based security protocol implemented by the Secure Channel (Schannel) security provider. SSL security protocols are used widely by Internet browsers and servers for authentication, message integrity, and confidentiality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&sbp=W3org&pver=1.0&ar=specs" target="_blank">Basic Authentication</a>
is a part of the HTTP 1.0 specification that sends password over networks in Base64 encoded format. Most browsers support this specification.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&sbp=W3org&pver=1.0&ar=specs" target="_blank">Digest Authentication</a>
sends authentication information over networks as a <em>hash</em> and is compatible with proxy servers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&sbp=RSA&pver=1.0&ar=securitystandards" target="_blank">PKCS&nbsp;#7</a>
describes the format of encrypted data such as digital signatures or digital envelopes that securely contain information. Both of these are involved in the certificate features of IIS.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&sbp=RSA&pver=1.0&ar=securitystandards" target="_blank">PKCS&nbsp;#10</a> describes the format of requests for certificates that are submitted to certification authorities.</p>

<p>For additional information about Windows and  network security issues, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&pver=1.0&ar=security" target="_blank">Microsoft Security Web site</a> or the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&sbp=ntserver&pver=1.0&ar=security" target="_blank">Windows Security Web site</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="getstarted">Setting Up Security</a></h2>
<p>Before configuring your Web server security, determine the level of security that you will require to protect your Web and FTP sites.  For example, if you intend create a Web site that allows special users to access private  information, such as financial or medical records, then you will require a robust security configuration. This configuration should be able to reliably authenticate designated users and restrict access to only those users.</p>

<p> Much of your Web server's security relies on your Windows security configuration. If you do not properly configure your Windows security features, you cannot secure your Web server.</p>

<p>If you have not done so already, carry out the following:</p> 

<ul>	
<li>Configure the Windows Administrator account.</li>
<li>Create and manage user accounts.</li>
<li>Create and manage groups.</li>
<li>Define Windows security policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, consult the Windows documentation.  The Microsoft&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;2000
Server Resource Kit is also an excellent source for security information.</p>

<p>As part of your security configuration, you should also convert your hard disk partition to an NTFS partition.  NTFS hard disk partitions offer precise file and directory access control, and save information more efficiently than File Allocation Table (FAT) partitions. You can use the Windows Convert utility to convert a hard disk partition to NTFS.  For more information, consult your Windows documentation.</p>

<p>Next, determine which files and directories will be publicly available to users visiting your Web and FTP sites.  Keep public and restricted content in separate directories.</p>

<p>To get started configuring your Web server's security, see <a href="iiacnsc.htm">About Access Control</a> for information about properly configuring anonymous Web server access.</p>
