<h2><a name="security">Security</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><img alt="New!" src="iinew1.gif"><a href="iiabasc.htm#Advanceddigest"><b>Advanced Digest Authentication</a>:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>Advanced Digest 
Authentication is lightweight, allows secure and robust authentication of users across proxy 
servers and firewalls, requires no additional client software, and avoids passing username and password in cleartext over the Internet. In addition, Digest Authentication, Anonymous, HTTP Basic, and Integrated 
Windows authentication (formerly known as Windows NT Challenge/Response 
authentication and NTLM authentication) are still available. 

<li><b>Secure Communications:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/iishelp/iis/htm/core/iiabtsc.htm">Secure Sockets Layer</a>&nbsp;(SSL)&nbsp;3.0 and Transport Layer Security (TLS) provide a secure way to exchange information between clients and servers. In addition, SSL&nbsp;3.0 and TLS provide a way for the server to verify who the client is <em>before</em> the user logs on to the server. In 
IIS&nbsp;5.1, client certificates are exposed to both ISAPI and Active 
Server Pages, so that programmers can track users through their sites. Also, 
IIS&nbsp;5.1 can map the client certificate to a Windows user account, 
so that administrators can control access to system resources based on the 
client certificate.  

<li><b><a href="iistesc.htm">Server-Gated 
  Cryptography</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
  Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC) is an extension of SSL that allows financial 
  institutions with export versions of IIS to use strong 128-bit encryption. 
  Although SGC capabilities are built into IIS&nbsp;5.0 and 5.1, a special SGC 
  certificate is required to use SGC. 
  
  <li><b><a href="iikeysc.htm">Security 
  Wizards</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
  Security wizards simplify server administration tasks.
	<ul>
	<li><b>The Web Server Certificate 
    Wizard</b> simplifies certificate administration tasks, such as creating 
    certificate requests and managing the certificate life cycle. 

	<li><b>The Permissions Wizard</b> makes it 
    easy to configure Web site access by assigning access policies to virtual 
    directories and files. The Permissions Wizard can also update NTFS file 
    permissions to reflect these Web access policies. 

	<li><b>The <a href="iikeysc.htm">CTL 
    Wizard</b></a> helps you configure your certificate 
    trust lists (CTLs). A CTL is a list of trusted certification authorities 
    (CAs) for a particular directory. CTLs are especially useful for Internet 
    service providers (ISPs) who have several Web sites on their server and who 
    need to have a different list of approved certification authorities for each 
    site.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><b>IP and 
  Internet Domain Restrictions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You can grant or deny Web 
  access to individual computers, groups of computers, or entire domains. 


<li><b><a name="kerb">Kerberos</a> v5 Authentication Protocol Compliance:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>IIS is fully integrated with the Kerberos&nbsp;v5 authentication 
  protocol implemented in Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;XP, allowing you to pass 
  authentication credentials among connected computers running Windows. 

<li><b>Certificate Storage:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>IIS certificate storage is 
  now integrated with the Windows CryptoAPI storage. The Windows Certificate 
  Manager provides a single point of entry that allows you to store, back up, 
  and configure server certificates. 

<li><b><a href="iiabtsc.htm#standardsused">Fortezza</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The U.S. government security standard, commonly called Fortezza, 
  is supported in IIS&nbsp;5.1. This standard satisfies the Defense 
  Message System security architecture with a cryptographic mechanism that 
  provides message confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and access 
  control to messages, components, and systems. These features can be 
  implemented both with server and browser software and with PCMCIA card 
  hardware.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="administration">Administration</a></h2> 

<ul>

<li><b><a href="iicodira.htm">Restarting 
  IIS</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Now you 
  can restart your Internet services without having to reboot your computer. 
  
<li><img alt="New!" src="iinew1.gif"><b>Backing Up and Restoring the Metabase</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Changes to metabase <a href="iitasks.htm">backup</a> and <a href="iirestore.htm">restore</a> capabilities and procedures enhance security and allow you to restore the metabase to other computers. The application is run from the <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a>.

<li><img alt="New!" src="iinew1.gif"><b><a href="iisnapshot.htm">Metabase Snapshot Writer</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Metabase Snapshot Writer (MSW) uses COM to ensure that NTbackup creates a stable and reliable backup of the metabase. MSW is used with NTbackup only, and is not a part of the Configuration Backup/Restore application that is run from the <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a>.

<li><img alt="New!" src="iinew1.gif"><b><a href="iipoolc.htm">ASP Template Caching</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Changes to ASP Template Cache Tuning give you enhanced control over caching of ASP files.
  
<li><b><a href="iierrcst.htm">Improved Custom Error Messages</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Now administrators can send informative 
  messages to clients when HTTP errors occur on their Web sites. Also includes 
  detailed ASP error processing capabilities through the use of the 500-100.asp 
  custom error message. You can use the custom errors that IIS&nbsp;5.1 
  provides, or create your own. 

<li><b>Configuration Options:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You can set permissions 
  for Read, Write, Execute, Script, and FrontPage Web operations at the site, 
  directory, or file level. 
  
  


<li>
<b>Remote Administration:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
  IIS&nbsp;5.1 has Web-based administration tools that allow remote 
  management of your server from almost any browser on any platform. With 
  IIS&nbsp;5.1, you can set up administration accounts called                                  Operators with limited administration 
  privileges on Web sites, to help distribute administrative tasks. 

<li><b>Terminal Services:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Terminal Services is a feature 
  of Windows&nbsp;XP that allows you to run 32-bit Windows applications on 
  terminals and terminal emulators running on personal computers and other 
  computer desktops. Terminal Services allows virtually any desktop to run 
  applications on the server. This enables you to remotely administer Windows XP
  services such as IIS as if you were at the server console, including 
  administration from older legacy PCs, or even non-PC devices such as UNIX 
  workstations with compatible client software. (Non-Windows-based client 
  devices require third-party add-on software.) 

<li><b>Centralized Administration:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Administration tools 
  for IIS use the Microsoft® Management Console (MMC). MMC hosts the programs, 
  called snap-ins, that administrators use to manage their servers. You can use the
  <a href="iiabuti.htm">IIS snap-in</a> from a computer running Windows&nbsp;XP Professional to 
  administer a computer on your intranet running Internet Information Services 
  on Windows&nbsp;2000 Server. 

</ul>

<h2><a name="programmability">Programmability</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Active Server Pages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You can create dynamic content by using server-side 
  scripting and components to create browser-independent dynamic content. 
                  <a href="/iishelp/iis/htm/asp/iiwawelc.htm">Active 
  Server Pages (ASP)</a> provides an easy-to-use 
  alternative to CGI and ISAPI by allowing content developers to embed any 
  scripting language or server component into their HTML pages. ASP provides 
  access to all of the HTTP request and response streams, as well as 
  standards-based database connectivity and the ability to customize content for 
  different browsers.

<li><b><a href="../asp/iiwanew.htm">New ASP 
  Features</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
  Active Server Pages has some new and improved features for enhancing 
  performance and streamlining your server&#150;side scripts. 

<li><b><a href="iiwarndc.htm#app_2">Application 
  Protection</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>IIS&nbsp; 5.1 offers greater protection and increased reliability for your Web applications. By default, IIS runs all of your applications in a common or <em>pooled</em> process that is separate from core IIS processes. In addition, you can still <em><a href="iiisol.htm">isolate</a></em> mission-critical applications that 
  should be run outside of both core IIS and pooled processes. 

<li><b>ADSI&nbsp;2.0:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>In IIS&nbsp;5.1, 
  administrators and application developers have the ability to add custom 
  objects, properties, and methods to the existing ADSI provider, giving 
  administrators even more flexibility in configuring their sites. 
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="standards">Internet Standards</a></h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Standards Based:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Microsoft Internet Information 
  Services&nbsp;5.0 and 5.1 comply with the HTTP&nbsp;1.1 standard, including 
  features such as PUT and DELETE, the ability to customize HTTP error messages, 
  and support for custom HTTP headers. 
  
  <li><b>Multiple Sites, One IP Address:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>With support for host headers, you can host 
  multiple Web sites on a single computer running Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000 
  Server with only one IP address. This is useful for Internet service providers 
  and corporate intranets hosting multiple sites. 

<li><b><a href="wcwbdav.htm">Web 
  Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Enables remote authors to 
  create, move, or delete files, file properties, directories, and directory 
  properties on your server over an HTTP connection. 
  
  <li><b>News and Mail:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You can use SMTP and NNTP Services to set up intranet mail and 
  news services that work in conjunction with IIS. 

<li><b>PICS Ratings:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You can apply Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) 
  ratings to sites that contain content for mature audiences. 

<li><b><a href="iivsovr.htm#ftpresume">FTP 
  Restart</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Now 
  File Transfer Protocol file downloads can be resumed without having to 
  download the entire file over again if an interruption occurs during data 
  transfer. 
  
  <li><b>HTTP 
  Compression:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
  Provides faster transmission of pages between the Web server and 
  compression-enabled clients. Compresses and caches static files, and performs 
  on-demand compression of dynamically generated files.                          </li>
