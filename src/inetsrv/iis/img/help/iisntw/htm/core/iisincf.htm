<h1><a name="H1_37754921">Using Server-Side Include Directives</a></h1>

<p>You use server-side include (SSI) directives to instruct the Web server to add text, graphic, or application content to a Web page just before sending the page to the client's browser. SSI provides special preprocessing directives that help you access information about a file or display the value of a CGI variable. SSI also provides a directive that you can use to insert the output from an application or a shell command into a Web page.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#0000FF">Important</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The #include statement is processed at compile time, not at run time. Therefore, you cannot incorporate this statement into the logic of your client-side procedures.</p>

<h2><a name="includingfiles">Including Files</a></h2>

<p>To include a file, use the <a href="iisiinc.htm"><strong>#include</strong></a> directive.  For example, to insert a file named Copyright.inc into a Web page when it is requested, use the following directive in the Web page:</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- #include file="Copyright.inc" --&gt;</pre>

<p>In this example, the file Copyright.inc must be in the same directory as the include file. The file that contains the <strong>#include</strong> directive must be a published file in your Web site. Included files do not require a special file name extension; however, it is considered good programming practice to give included files an .inc extension to distinguish them from other types of files.</p>

<p>To locate the include file by specifying a path relative to the current directory, use the <strong>file</strong> argument.  For example, if the calling file is in a directory named Documents and the include file is in a subdirectory named Documents\Common, use the following directive:</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- #include file="Common\Copyright.inc" --&gt;</pre>

<p>While you are working with documents in a Web site, you may want to store shared files in a special virtual directory. To locate the include file by specifying the full virtual path to the file, use the <strong>virtual</strong> argument. For example, to include a file from the /Common virtual directory, use the following directive:</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- #include virtual="/Common/Copyright.inc" --&gt;</pre>


<h2><a name="H2_37756964"> Including Output from Applications</a></h2>

<p>In addition to including the contents of a file, you can run an application or a shell command by using an SSI directive and include the output on your Web page. To run an application or a shell command, use the <a href="iisiexc.htm"><strong>#exec</strong></a> directive. The application can be a CGI program, an ASP application, or an ISAPI extension.  For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- #exec cgi=/scripts/guestbook.exe?FirstName+LastName&gt;</pre>

<p>The path to the application must be a full virtual path, or URL. You can pass parameters to the application by following the application's file name with a question mark (?) and a list of parameters joined by plus signs (+).</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Important</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing ordinary Web files to run applications presents a security risk.  You can disable the <strong>#exec</strong> directive and still allow Web pages to use the other SSI directives. 

<p>For more information, see the <a href="iisiref.htm">Server&#150;Side Includes Reference</a>.</p>
