<p><blockquote><strong>CA</strong><br>
<em>See</em> <strong>certification authority</strong>.

<P><strong> cache </a> </strong><br>
A special memory subsystem in which frequently used data values are duplicated for quick access. A memory cache stores the contents of frequently accessed RAM locations and the addresses where these data items are stored. When the processor references an address in memory, the cache checks to see whether it holds that address. If it does, the data is returned to the processor; if it does not, a regular memory access occurs. A cache is useful when RAM accesses are slow compared with the microprocessor speed, because cached memory is faster than main RAM memory.</p>

<p><strong> call </strong><br>
To transfer program execution to some section of code (usually a subroutine) while saving the necessary information to allow execution to resume at the calling point when the called section has completed execution. When a subroutine call occurs, one or more values (known as arguments or parameters) are often passed to the subroutine, which can then use and sometimes modify these values.</p>

<p><strong> Common Gateway Interface (CGI)  </strong><br>
A server-side interface for initiating software services.
The specification that defines communications between information services (such as an HTTP service) and resources on the server's host computer, such as databases and other programs. For example, when a user submits a form through a Web browser, the HTTP service executes a program (often called a CGI script) and passes the user's input information to that program through CGI.

A specification developed by the Object Management Group in 1992 in which pieces of programs (objects) communicate with other objects in other programs, even if the two programs are written in  different programming languages and are running on different platforms. A program makes its request for objects through an object request broker, or ORB, and thus does not need to know the structure of the program from where the object comes. CORBA is designed to work in object-oriented environments.</p>

<p><strong>communications protocol  </strong><br>
A set of rules or standards designed to enable computers to connect with one another and to exchange information with as few errors as possible.
