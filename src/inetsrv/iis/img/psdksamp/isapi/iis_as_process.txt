Running IIS as a Process Instead of a Service
---------------------------------------------

When debugging ISAPI applications, ISAPI filters, server components, or other code you are writing to run on top of IIS or PWS on Windows NT, it is sometimes convenient to run IIS as a process. This allows you to start inetinfo.exe from the command line or from inside your development tools, instead of managing it as an NT service, as happens by default.
