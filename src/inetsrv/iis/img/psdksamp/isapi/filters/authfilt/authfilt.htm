<I>AuthFilt - A Filter for Advanced Authentication</I>
<HR>

<P>
AuthFilt demonstrates how to write an authentication filter based on an external
datasource.  Authentication is the process of accepting or denying a request from a client,
so AuthFilt will be notified each time an authentication request comes in.  This sample uses a
file (c:\inetsrv\userdb.txt) to keep track of authorized users, but you
might modify this sample to access a database which holds user info.  The file c:\inetsrv\userdb.txt
does not exist.  Please look at Db.c to see how to make such a file and change the location
of the file if you so desire.
<P>
For each authentication request, AuthFilt first looks in a cache of recently
authenticated users, and when that fails, AuthFilt looks in the userdb.txt file.
This shows an efficient way to authorize connections: a cache allows the
filter to quickly authenticate users, and because each request comes in through the
filter, speed is critical.

Steps to build the sample:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Type "nmake" at the command line in the AuthFilt directory.  If you 
 encounter problems with missing header files, make sure your INCLUDE
 variable points to the Win32 SDK include directory, the VC++ include
 directory, and the IIS 4.0 include directory.  Also, make sure LIB 
 variable points to the Win32 SDK lib directory.

You can load the authfilt project file (authfilt.dsp) and build the
sample using the build authfilt.dll command.
<P>
<LI>Run the Internet Server Manager and add the full path to authfilt.dll as a filter
to either the Master Root Properties or as a Website filter.
