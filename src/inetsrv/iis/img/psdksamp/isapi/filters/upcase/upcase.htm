<h1>Internet Server Sample Filter: UpCase</h1>
<hr>
<b><i>"Where do you want to uppercase today?"</i></b>
<hr>
This sample works by monitoring requests for .htm files in a directory path
that ends with /UC. It then strips the trailing /UC from the directory path
and uppercases the body of the HTML text that goes by.
<P>

To install this filter, use the Internet Service Manager in the Start menu.
<pre>
Start\
  Programs\
    Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack\
      Microsoft Internet Information Server\
        Internet Service Manager
</pre>
<P>
Right mouse click on the Web Site you wish to install the filter on.  Choose
Properties.  Click on the ISAPI Filters tab, and add the filter.
<P>
Like any ISAPI Filter, this DLL is loaded when the web server is started
and it stays loaded until the  server is stopped.
