<H1>FormDump - Dumps HTML form data</H1>

<p>
<I>FormDump</I> - Form Decoder and Dumper
<HR>

<p> This sample illustrates how to write an ISAPI Extension DLL that can
be used to obtain form data from a web browser, and also how to build a
reply to the form.  <p>

FormDump first appeared in the first release of the Internet SDK.  This
version adds two useful features--output of the user account and a dump
of all server variables.
<p>

FormDump's HttpExtensionProc does the following:
<P>
<OL><LI>Sends the header of the HTML response
<LI>Parses inbound form fields and send them back as HTML
<LI>Determines the security context in which the thread is running,
    and return the domain and user as HTML
<LI>Uses GetServerVariable to retrieve all server variables, and
    send them back as HTML
<LI>Sends the footer of the HTML resoponse
<LI>Returns control to IIS
</OL>
<p>

Along with the basic HTML output functions found in the original
version of FormDump, this version adds HtmlPrintf(). See html.h
and html.cpp for details.
<p>

Here is an example of how this utility works. If you submit this form to
FormDump.Dll, it shows you the values that the various form parameters
were decoded to.

<p>

You can use FormDump.Dll with any form.  It is useful in understanding
how data comes in from the web browser.
