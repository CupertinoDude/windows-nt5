<h1>Internet Server Sample: CGI Wrapper for ISAPI DLLs</h1>
<body>
This sample shows how to wrap an ISAPI DLL  in a CGI executable, on systems
that cannot use the DLL for some reason.
To use this sample, simply build it by running <I> nmake</I> on the 
makefile provided.
This will create cgiwrap.exe which can be renamed to match the name
of the DLL. For example, to call foo.dll from this wrapper, rename 
cgiwrap.exe to foo.exe
<p>
This sample can also be used to aid in debugging.  If you have a text file that
contains a full http query (for POSTed forms; GET forms are all on the command
line) then you can run this program under a debugger to analyze your sample.
Please keep in mind that this is not the same environment as running as
a service under IIS. Also, this sample, unlike IIS, is single threaded.
