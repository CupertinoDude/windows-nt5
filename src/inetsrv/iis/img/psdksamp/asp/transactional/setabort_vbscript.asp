        <!-- Brief Description blurb.  -->

        This is an example demonstrating a forced abort
        within a Transacted Web Page.  When an abort occurs,
        all transacted changes within this web page (Database Access,
        MSMQ Message Transmission, etc.) will be rolled back to
        their previous state -- guarenteeing data integrity.
