	<P>This sample demonstrates how to send a simple asynchronous message using 
        the Microsoft Message Queueing Server (MSMQ).  MSMQ is one of the components
        that comes with the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.
  
        <P>For this example to work, MSMQ must be first be installed on the host machine.
        Using the MSMQ Explorer, a queue named "IIS_SDK_EXAMPLE" should then be created.
        After the example is run, return to the MSMQ Explorer and select "Refresh" from
        the "View" menu.  The recently sent message will then appear within the "IIS_SDK_EXAMPLE"
        queue.

		<%
			//Create MSMQQueueInfo component to open
			//MessageQueue.

			QueueInfo = Server.CreateObject("MSMQ.MSMQQueueInfo")


			//Open queue. The queue can be physically 
			//located on any machine. The period in the 
			//line below indicates that the queue is 
			//located on the local machine. Note that 
			//because JScript is being used as the 
			//scripting language, an extra backslash 
			//must be inserted as an escape character.

			QueueInfo.pathname = ".\\IIS_SDK_EXAMPLE";
			Queue = QueueInfo.Open(2, 0);


			//Create message component for queue.
            
			Msg = Server.CreateObject("MSMQ.MSMQMessage");


			//Construct message. Anything can be passed 
			//into both the body and label. The developer is 
			//responsible for marshaling all arguments.  
			//Note that the delivery property has been sent 
			//to "Recoverable." This will guarantee that the 
			//message will survive a crash or shutdown on the 
			//queue machine.
            
			Msg.body = "This is the message body";
			Msg.Label = "This is the message label";
			Msg.Delivery = 1;


			//Send message.
		    
			Msg.Send(Queue);


			//Close queue.
            
			Queue.Close();
