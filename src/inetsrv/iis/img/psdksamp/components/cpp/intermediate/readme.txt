Overview
========

This is the ATL (ActiveX Template Library) version of the Power
sample object for Active Server Pages.  It demonstrates how to write
a component that makes use of the intrinsic ASP objects.

Please read the top-level ReadMe for the Simple and Power (found in
the \intermediate folder) samples.

Look at CATLPwr.idl, Power.h, and Power.cpp to see how these
methods and properties are declared and implemented.
