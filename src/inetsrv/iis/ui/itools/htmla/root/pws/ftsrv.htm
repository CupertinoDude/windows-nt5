<H2>FTP Service Properties</H2>

<P>
You use the <B>Service</B> property sheet to control who can use
your server and specify the account used for anonymous client
requests to log on to the computer. Most Internet sites allow
anonymous logons. If you allow anonymous logons, then all user
permissions for the user, such as permission to access information,
will use the IUSR_<I>computername</I> account. To use your current
security system to control information access, change the anonymous
logon account from IUSR_<I>computername</I>  to an existing account
on your network.
<P>
This property sheet also sets the comment in the Internet Service
Manager <B>Report </B>view. 
<H3>TCP Port</H3>

<P>
Determines the port on which the FTP service is running. The default
is port 21. You can change the port to any unique TCP port number.
For a new port number to take effect, you must restart your computer.
<H3>Connection Timeout</H3>

<P>
Sets the length of time in seconds before the server disconnects
an inactive user. It is recommended that you not set this number
lower than 100 seconds. The maximum you can set is 32,767 seconds.
This value ensures that all connections are closed if the FTP
protocol fails to close a connection.
<H3>Maximum Connections</H3>

<P>
Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the server.
<H3>Allow Anonymous Connections</H3>

<P>
Sets the Windows NT user account to use for permissions of all
anonymous connections. By default, Peer Web Services creates and
uses the account IUSR_<I>computername</I> for all anonymous logons.
Note that the password is used only within Windows NT; anonymous
users do not log on using this user name and password.
<P>
Typically, anonymous FTP users will use "anonymous"
as the user name and their e-mail address as the password. The
FTP service then uses the IUSR_<I>computername</I> account as
the logon account for permissions.
<H3>Allow only anonymous connections</H3>

<P>
Select this box to all only anonymous connections. With this box
selected, users cannot logon with user names and passwords. This
prevents access by using an account with administrative permission;
only the account specifed for anonymous access is granted access.
<H3>Comment</H3>

<P>
Specifies the comment displayed in the Report view of Internet
Service Manager.
<H3>Current Sessions</H3>

<P>
Click to display the current FTP users.
