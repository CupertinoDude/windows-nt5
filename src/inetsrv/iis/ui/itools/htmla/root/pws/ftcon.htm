<H2>WWW Grant or Deny Access</H2>

<P>
Choose <B>Single Computer</B> and provide the Internet Protocol
(IP) address to exclude a single computer. <B>Choose Group of
Computers</B> and provide an IP address and subnet mask to exclude
a group of computers. Press the button next to the IP address
to use a domain name system (DNS) name instead of IP address.
Your server must have a DNS server specified in its Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP/IP) settings.
<P>
You are specifying, by IP address or domain name, which computer
or group of computers will be granted or denied access. If you
choose to, by default, grant access to all users, you will specify
the computers to be denied access. If you choose to, by default,
deny access to all users, you will then specify the specific computers
to be allowed access. You should fully understand TCP/IP networking,
IP addressing, and the use of subnet masks to use this option.
