The gopher <B>Service</B> property sheet sets user properties
for the gopher service.
<H3>TCP Port</H3>

Determines the port on which the gopher service is running. The
default is port 70. You can change the port to any unique TCP
port number. For a new port number to take effect, you must restart
your computer.
<H3>Connection Timeout</H3>

Sets the length of time before the server disconnects an inactive
user. This value ensures that all connections are closed if the
gopher protocol fails to close a connection.
