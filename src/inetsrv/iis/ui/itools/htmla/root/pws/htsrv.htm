<H1>WWW Service Properties</H1>

<P>
You use the <B>Service</B> property sheet to control who can use
your server and to specify the account used for anonymous client
requests to log on to the computer. If you allow anonymous logons,
then all user permissions for the user, such as permission to
access information, will use the IUSR_<I>computername</I> account.
To use your current security system to control information access,
change the anonymous logon account from IUSR_<I>computername</I>
 to an existing account on your network.
<P>
This property sheet also sets the comment in the main Internet
Service Manager window. 
<H3>TCP Port</H3>

<P>
Determines the port on which the WWW service is running. The default
is port 80. You can change the port to any unique TCP port number.
For a new port number to take effect, you must restart your computer.
<H3>Connection Timeout</H3>

<P>
Sets the length of time before the server disconnects an inactive
user. This value ensures that all connections are closed if the
HTTP protocol fails to close a connection.
<H3>Anonymous Logon</H3>

<P>
Sets the Windows NT user account to use for permissions of all
anonymous connections. By default, Peer Web Services creates and
uses the account IUSR_<I>computername</I>. Note that the password
is used only within Windows NT; anonymous users do not log on
by using a user name and password.
<H3>Password Authentication</H3>

<P>
Specifies the authentication process to use if anonymous access
is not allowed or the remote client requests authentication.
<P>
Basic authentication is encoded. Basic authentication is typically
used in conjunction with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to ensure
that user names and passwords are encrypted before transmission.
All browsers support Basic authentication.
<P>
Windows NT Challenge/Response automatically encrypts user names
and passwords. 
<H3>Comment</H3>

<P>
Specifies the comment displayed in Internet Service Manager <B>Report
</B>view.
<P>

Guide</I>. Choose Help Topics from Internet Service Manager, or
click the Product Documentation icon in the Microsoft Peer Web
Services program group.
