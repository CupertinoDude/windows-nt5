<H3>Add, Remove, and Edit buttons</H3>

<P>
To set up a directory, press the <B>Add</B> button or select a
directory in the Directories listing box and press the <B>Edit</B>
button. The <B>Remove</B> button removes the directories that
you select.
<H3>Enable Default Document and Directory Browsing Allowed</H3>

<P>
The <B>Default Document</B> and <B>Directory Browsing</B> settings
in the <B>Directories</B> property sheet for the WWW service are
used to set up default displays that will appear if a remote user
does not specify a particular file. Directory browsing means that
the user is presented with a hypertext listing of the directories
and files so that the user can navigate through your directory
structure.
<P>
You can place a default document in each directory so that when
a remote user does not specify a particular file, the default
document in that directory is displayed. A hypertext directory
listing is sent to the user if directory browsing is enabled and
no default document is in the specified directory.
<P>
Note that virtual directories will not appear in directory listings;
users must know a virtual directory's alias and type in its Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) address, or click a link in a HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) page, to access virtual directories.
<P>

and Administration Guide</I>. Choose Help Topics from Internet
