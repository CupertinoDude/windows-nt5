<H2>FTP Directory Properties</H2>

<P>
Configure the FTP service directories by using this dialog box.
<H3>Directory</H3>

<P>
Sets the path to the directory to use for the FTP service.
<H3>Browse button</H3>

<P>
Use to select the directory to use for the FTP service.
<H3>Home Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify the root directory for the FTP service.
<P>
Internet Information Server provides a default home directory,
\Ftproot, for the FTP service. The files that you place in the
FTP home directory, and its subdirectories, are available to remote
browsers. You can change the location of the default home directory.

<H3>Virtual Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify a subdirectory for the FTP service.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Alias</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="MS Sans Serif">
</FONT>Enter a name for the virtual directory. This is the name
that is used to connect to the directory.
<P>
You can add other directories outside the home directory that
are accessible to browsers as subdirectories of the home directory.
That is, you can publish from other directories and have those
directories accessible from within the home directory. Such directories
are called "virtual directories."
<P>
Note that virtual directories will not appear in FTP directory
listings; FTP users must know the virtual directory's alias, and
type in its URL address in the FTP application or browser.
<P>
The administrator can specify the physical location of the virtual
directory and the virtual name (alias), which is the directory
name used by remote browsers. 
<P>
The published directories can be located on local or network drives.
If the virtual directory is a network drive, provide the user
name and password with access to that network drive. Virtual directories
on network drives must be on computers in the same Windows NT
domain as the Internet Information Server.
<H3>Account Information</H3>

<P>
This box is active only if the directory specifed in the first
line of this dialog box is a Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
server and share name, for example, \\Webserver\Htmlfiles. Enter
the user name and password that has permission to use the network
directory. Virtual directories on network drives must be on computers
in the same Windows NT domain as the computer running Internet
Information Server.
<P>
<B>Important  </B>If you specify a user name and password to connect
to a network drive, all Internet Information Server access to
that directory will use that user name and password. You should
use care when using UNC connections to network drives to prevent
possible security breaches.
<H3>Access check boxes</H3>

<P>
The <B>Access</B> check boxes control the attributes of the directory.
If the files are on an NTFS drive, NTFS settings for the directory
must match these settings.
