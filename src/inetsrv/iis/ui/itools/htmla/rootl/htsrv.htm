<H1>WWW Service Properties</H1>

<P>
You use the <B>Service</B> property sheet to control who can use
your server and to specify the account used for anonymous client
requests to log on to the computer. Most Internet sites allow
anonymous logons. If you allow anonymous logons, then all user
permissions for the user, such as permission to access information,
will use the IUSR_<I>computername</I> account. To use your current
security system to control information access, change the anonymous
logon account from IUSR_<I>computername</I>  to an existing account
on your network.
<P>
This property sheet also sets the comment in the main Internet
Service Manager window. 
<H3>TCP Port</H3>

<P>
Determines the port on which the WWW service is running. The default
is port 80. You can change the port to any unique TCP port number.
For a new port number to take effect, you must restart your computer.
<H3>Connection Timeout</H3>

<P>
Sets the length of time before the server disconnects an inactive
user. This value ensures that all connections are closed if the
HTTP protocol fails to close a connection.
<H3>Maximum Connections</H3>

<P>
Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the WWW
service.
<H3>Anonymous Logon</H3>

<P>
Sets the Windows NT user account to use for permissions of all
anonymous connections. By default, Internet Information Server
creates and uses the account IUSR_<I>computername</I>. Note that
the password is used only within Windows NT; anonymous users do
not log on by using a user name and password.
<p>
When you installed Internet Information Server, Setup created the account IUSR_computername in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains and in the Internet Service Manager. This account was assigned a random password. The password for this account must be the same, both in Internet Service Manager and in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains. If you change the password, you must change it in both places and make sure it matches. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This account must have a password. You cannot assign a blank password.
</p>
<p>
The IUSR_computername is granted <b>Log on locally</b> user rights by default. This right is necessary as long as you want to grant anonymous logon access to your site.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> To grant access to a specific user, you must grant that user Log on locally rights in Windows NT Server User Manager for Domains.
</p>
<H3>Password Authentication</H3>

<P>
Specifies the authentication process to use if anonymous access
is not allowed or the remote client requests authentication.
<P>
Basic authentication is encoded. Basic authentication is often
used in conjunction with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to ensure
that user names and passwords are encrypted before transmission.
All browsers support Basic authentication. Note that, when not used in conjunction with SSL, Basic authentication sends passwords in clear (unencrypted) text. 

<P>
Windows NT Challenge/Response automatically encrypts user names
and passwords. Internet Explorer version 2.0 and later supports
this password authentication scheme.
<H3>Comment</H3>

<P>
Specifies the comment displayed in Internet Service Manager <B>Report
</B>view.
<P>

and Administration Guide</I>. Choose Help Topics from Internet
Service Manager, or click the Product Documentation icon in the
Microsoft Internet Server program group.
