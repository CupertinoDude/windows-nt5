<H1>Gopher Directory Properties</H1>

<P>
Configure the gopher service directories by using this dialog
box. Press the <B>Add</B> button on the <B>Directories</B> property
sheet to set up new directories.
<H3>Directory</H3>

<P>
Sets the path to the directory to use for the gopher service.
<H3>Browse button</H3>

<P>
Use to select the directory to use for the gopher service.
<H3>Home Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify the root directory for the gopher service.

<P>
Peer Web Services provides a default home directory, \Gophroot,
for the gopher service. The files that you place in the gopher
home directory, and its subdirectories, are available to remote
browsers. You can change the location of the default home directory.

<H3>Virtual Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify a subdirectory for the gopher service.
Enter the directory name or "alias" that service users
will use.
<P>
These directories are accessed using the alias in the Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) as if the alias were a subdirectory of
the home directory. That is, you can publish from other directories
and have those directories accessible from within the home directory.
Such directories are called "virtual directories."
<P>
Note that virtual directories will not appear in gopher directory
listings; you must create explict links in tag files in order
for users to access virtual directories. Users can also type in
the URL if they know the alias for the virtual directory; however,
they must precede the alias name with "11/". For example,
to access the virtual directory "books" from your gopher
server which is named gopher.company.com, you would use the following
URL:
<P>
gopher://gopher.company.com/11/books
<P>
The administrator can specify the physical location of the virtual
directory and the virtual name (alias), which is the directory
name used by remote browsers. 
<P>
The published directories can be located on local or network drives.
If the virtual directory is a network drive, provide the user
name and password with access to that network drive. Virtual directories
on network drives must be on computers in the same Windows NT
domain as the computer running Peer Web Services.
<H3>Account Information</H3>

<P>
This box is active only if the Directory specifed in the first
line of this dialog box is a Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
server and share name, for example, \\Webserver\Htmlfiles. Enter
the user name and password that has permission to use the network
directory. Virtual directories on network drives must be on computers
in the same Windows NT domain as the computer running Peer Web
Services.
<P>
<B>Important  </B>If you specify a user name and password to connect
to a network drive, all Peer Web Services access to that directory
will use that user name and password. You should use care when
using UNC connections to network drives to prevent possible security
breaches.

Guide</I>. Choose Help Topics from Internet Service Manager, or
