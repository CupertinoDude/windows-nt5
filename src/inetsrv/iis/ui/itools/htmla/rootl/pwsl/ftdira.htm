<H1>FTP Directory Properties</H1>

<P>
Configure the FTP service directories by using this dialog box.
<H3>Directory</H3>

<P>
Sets the path to the directory to use for the FTP service.
<H3>Browse button</H3>

<P>
Use to select the directory to use for the FTP service.
<H3>Home Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify the root directory for the FTP service.
<P>
Peer Web Services provides a default home directory, \Ftproot,
for the FTP service. The files that you place in the FTP home
directory, and its subdirectories, are available to remote browsers.
You can change the location of the default home directory. 
<H3>Virtual Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify a subdirectory for the FTP service.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Alias</FONT></B> Enter a name for the virtual
directory. This is the name that is used to connect to the directory.
<P>
Enter the directory name or "alias" that service users
will use.
<P>
You can add other directories outside the home directory that
are accessible to browsers as subdirectories of the home directory.
That is, you can publish from other directories and have those
directories accessible from within the home directory. Such directories
are called "virtual directories."
<P>
Note that virtual directories will not appear in FTP directory
listings; FTP users must know the virtual directory's alias, and
type in its URL address in the FTP application or browser.
<P>
The administrator can specify the physical location of the virtual
directory and the virtual name (alias), which is the directory
name used by remote browsers. 
<P>
The published directories can be located on local or network drives.
If the virtual directory is a network drive, provide the user
name and password with access to that network drive. Virtual directories
on network drives must be on computers in the same Windows NT
domain as the computer running Peer Web Services.
<H3>Account Information</H3>

<P>
This box is active only if the directory specifed in the first
line of this dialog box is a Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
server and share name, for example, \\Webserver\Htmlfiles. Enter
the user name and password that has permission to use the network
directory. Virtual directories on network drives must be on computers
in the same Windows NT domain as the computer running Peer Web
Services.
<P>
<B>Important  </B>If you specify a user name and password to connect
to a network drive, all Peer Web Services access to that directory
will use that user name and password. You should use care when
using UNC connections to network drives to prevent possible security
breaches.
<H3>Access check boxes</H3>

<P>
The <B>Access</B> check boxes control the attributes of the directory.
If the files are on an NTFS drive, NTFS settings for the directory
must match these settings.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Read</FONT></B> Must be selected for FTP directories.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Write</FONT></B> Allows clients to write files
to the FTP server. Select this only for directories that are intended
to accept files from users.
<P>

Guide</I>. Choose Help Topics from Internet Service Manager, or

Services program group.
