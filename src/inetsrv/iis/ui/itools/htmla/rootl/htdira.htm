<H1>WWW Directory Properties</H1>

<P>
Configure the WWW service directories by using this dialog box.
Press the <B>Add</B> button on the <B>Directories</B> property
sheet to set up new directories.
<H3>Directory</H3>

<P>
Sets the path to the directory to use for the WWW service.
<H3>Browse button</H3>

<P>
Use to select the directory to use for the WWW service.
<H3>Home Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify the root directory for the WWW service.
<P>
Internet Information Server provides a default home directory,
\Wwwroot, for the WWW service. The files that you place in the
WWW home directory, and its subdirectories, are available to remote
browsers. You can change the location of the default home directory.

<H3>Virtual Directory</H3>

<P>
Choose this to specify a subdirectory for the WWW service. Enter
the directory name or "alias" that service users will
use to gain access.
<P>
You can add other directories outside the home directory that
are accessed by browsers as subdirectories of the home directory.
That is, you can publish from other directories and have those
directories accessible from within the home directory. Such directories
are called "virtual directories."
<P>
The administrator can specify the physical location of the virtual
directory and the virtual name (alias), which is the directory
name used by remote browsers. 
<P>
Note that virtual directories will not appear in WWW directory
listings; you must create explicit links in HTML files in order
for users to access virtual directories. Users can also type in
the URL if they know the alias for the virtual directory.
<P>
The published directories can be located on local or network drives.
If the virtual directory is a network drive, provide the user
name and password with access to that network drive. Virtual directories
on network drives must be on computers in the same Windows NT
domain as the Internet Information Server.
<H3>Account Information</H3>

<P>
This box is active only if the directory specified in the first
line of this dialog box is a Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
server and share name, for example, \\Webserver\Htmlfiles. Enter
the user name and password that has permission to use the network
directory. Virtual directories on network drives must be on computers
in the same Windows NT domain as the Internet Information Server.
<P>
<B>Important  </B>If you specify a user name and password to connect
to a network drive, all Internet Information Server access to
that directory will use that user name and password. You should
use care when using UNC connections to network drives to prevent
possible security breaches.
<H3>Virtual Servers (World Wide Web only)</H3>

<P>
Select the <B>Virtual Server</B> check box and enter an IP (Internet
Protocol) address to create a directory for the virtual server.
The IP address must be bound to the network card providing the
service. Use the Network applet in Control Panel to bind additional
IP addresses to your network card.
<P>
You can have multiple domain names on a single Internet Information
Server-based computer so that it will appear that there are additional
servers, or "virtual servers." This feature makes it
possible to service WWW requests for two domain names (such as
http://www.company1.com/ and http://www.company2.com/) from the
same computer. Enter the IP address for the home directory, and
virtual directories for each virtual server that you will create.
<P>
If the path for a virtual directory is a network drive, provide
a user name and password with access to that network drive. Virtual
directories on network drives must be on computers in the same
Windows NT domain as the Internet Information Server-based computer.
<P>
<B>Important</B>   If you have assigned more than one IP address
to your server, when you create a directory you must specify which
IP address has access to that directory. If no IP address is specified,
that directory will be visible to all virtual servers. The default
directories created during setup do not specify an IP address.
You may need to specify IP addresses for the default directories
when you add virtual servers.
<H3>Access check boxes</H3>

<P>
The <B>Access</B> check boxes control the attributes of the directory.
If the files are on an NT File System (NTFS) drive, NTFS settings
for the directory must match these settings.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Read</FONT></B> Must be selected for information
directories. Do not select this box for directories containing
programs.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Execute</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="MS Sans Serif">
</FONT>Allows clients to run any programs in this directory. This
box is selected by default for the directory created for programs.
Put all your scripts and executable files into this directory.
Do not select this box for directories containing static content.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Require secure SSL channel</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="MS Sans Serif">
</FONT>Select this box if using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security
to encrypt data transmissions. If you do not have a certificate enabled, this box well not display.
