<H2>Gopher Service Properties</H2>

<P>
The gopher <B>Service</B> property sheet sets user properties
for the gopher service.
<H3>TCP Port</H3>

<P>
Determines the port on which the gopher service is running. The
default is port 70. You can change the port to any unique TCP
port number. For a new port number to take effect, you must restart
your computer.
<H3>Connection Timeout</H3>

<P>
Sets the length of time before the server disconnects an inactive
user. This value ensures that all connections are closed if the
gopher protocol fails to close a connection.
<H3>Maximum Connections</H3>

<P>
Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the gopher
service.
<H3>Service administrator</H3>

<P>
Specifies the values the gopher service will report to gopher
service users.
<H3>Anonymous Logon</H3>

<P>
Sets the Windows NT user account to use for permissions of all
anonymous connections. By default, Internet Information Server
creates and uses the account IUSR_<I>computername</I>. Note that
the password is used only within Windows NT; anonymous users do
not log on using a user name and password.
<p>
When you installed Internet Information Server, Setup created the account IUSR_computername in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains and in the Internet Service Manager. This account was assigned a random password. The password for this account must be the same, both in Internet Service Manager and in the Windows NT User Manager for Domains. If you change the password, you must change it in both places and make sure it matches. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This account must have a password. You cannot assign a blank password.
</p>
<p>
The IUSR_computername is granted <b>Log on locally</b> user rights by default. This right is necessary as long as you want to grant anonymous logon access to your site.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> To grant access to a specific user, you must grant that user Log on locally rights in Windows NT Server User Manager for Domains.
</p>


<H3>Comment</H3>

</B>view.

and Administration Guide</I>. Choose Help Topics from Internet
