<H2>FTP Logging Properties</H2>

<P>
The <B>Logging</B> property sheet sets logging  for the selected
information service.
<P>
Logging provides valuable information about how a server is used.
You can send log data to files or to an Open Data Base Connectivity
(ODBC)-supported database. If you have multiple servers or services
on a network, you can log all their activity to a single file
or database on any network computer.
<P>
If you want to log to a file, you can specify how often to create
new logs and which directory put the log files in. The <B>Convlog.exe</B>
command prompt command converts log files to either European Microsoft
Windows NT Academic Centre (EMWAC) log files or the common log
file format.
<P>
If you log to an ODBC data source, you must specify the ODBC Data
Source Name (DSN), table, and valid user name and password to
the database.
<H3>Enable Logging</H3>

<P>
Select this box to start or stop logging for the selected information
service.
<H3>Log to File</H3>

<P>
Choose this option to log to a text file for the selected information
service.
<H3>Log Format</H3>

<P>
Click the down arrow and choose either Standard format or National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) format.
<H3>Automatically open new log</H3>

<P>
Select this box to generate new logs at the specifed interval.

<H3>Log file directory</H3>

<P>
Shows the path to the directory containing all log files. To change
directories, click <B>Browse</B> and select a different directory.
<H3>Log file name</H3>

<P>
Names the log file. The lowercase letters <B>yy</B> will be replaced
with the year, <B>mm</B> will be replaced with the month, and
<B>dd</B> will be replaced with the day.
<H3>Log to SQL/ODBC Database </H3>

<P>
Choose to log to any ODBC data source. Set the Datasource name,
Table name (not the file name of the table), and specify a user
name and password that is valid for the computer on which the
database resides. You must also use the ODBC applet in Control
Panel to create a system data source.
<P>
