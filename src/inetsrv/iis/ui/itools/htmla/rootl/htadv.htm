<h2>WWW Advanced Properties</h2>

<body>

<p>The <b>Advanced</b> property sheet sets access by specific IP address to block individuals or groups from gaining access to your server. You can also set the maximum network bandwidth for outbound traffic, to control the maximum amount of traffic on your server.</p>

<h3>IP Access Control</h3>
<p>
You can control access to each Internet service by specifying the IP address of the computers to be granted or denied access.

If you choose to grant access to all users by default, you can then specify the computers to be denied access. For example, if you have a form on your WWW server and a particular user on the Internet is entering multiple forms with ficticious information, you can prevent the computer at that IP address from connecting to your site. Conversely, if you choose to deny access to all users by default, you can then specify which computers are allowed access.
