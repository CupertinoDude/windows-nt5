<H2>Gopher Advanced Properties</H2>

<P>
The <B>Advanced</B> property sheet sets access by specific Internet
Protocol (IP) address to block individuals or groups from gaining
access to your server. You can also set the maximum network bandwidth
for outbound traffic, to control the maximum amount of traffic
allowed on your server.
<H3>IP Access Control</H3>

<P>
You can control access to each Internet service by specifying
the IP address of the computers to be granted or denied access.
<P>
If you choose to grant access to all users by default, you can
then specify the computers to be denied access. For example, if
you have a form on your WWW server and a particular user on the
Internet is entering multiple forms with ficticious information,
you can prevent the computer at that IP address from connecting
to your site. Conversely, if you choose to deny access to all
users by default, you can then specify which computers are allowed
access.
