How to build Denali using the NTBuild tools.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

***NOTE: The below method shows the "official" list of things to copy.  This will total 
about 250+ mb of stuff and take quite some time.  An easier way would be to copy the tree
on \\andrews\ntbuild.  This contains the 65mb of stuff that you actually need.
Note: hopefully you dont even need all of that.  I will attempt to whittle it
down further when I have time***

mkdir \nt
mkdir \nt\public
mkdir \nt\private
mkdir \nt\private\developer

net view \\ntx86? (where ? is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) I used 5
Choose the latest FreePub, I used FreePub.1311
e.g. net use n: \\ntx865\freepub.1311

Copy tree from ntx86 to \nt\public on your hd.
e.g. xcopy n:\ c:\nt\public /e
>> This is 210mb of junk.  You dont need any of the non i386 stuff,
	and you dont need 99% of the other stuff either.  I copied
	over only what I needed.  I will share out my directory tree
	so you can copy exactly what I copied if you want to save space.
	There's 150mb of libs, and we only need a fraction of that.  
	I copied over a lot of H files that I dont think we need, but
	we can deal with that later.

net use x: \\x86fre\sources
If you dont have perms, send mail to the email alias NUTS

Copy the contents of the Developr subdirectory on \\x86fre\sources to
\nt\private\developr on your machine.
e.g. xcopy x:\developr c:\nt\private\developr /e

net view \\ntx86? (where ? is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) I used 5
Choose the latest NNNNFre.Srv, I used 1311Fre.Srv
e.g. net use m: \\ntx865\1311Fre.Srv
Choose or create a directory on your machine that is (or will be) on
your path.  I created a directory under \nt called MSTools
e.g. mkdir \nt\mstools
Copy the contents of the \mstools directory & the \idw directory
from the ntx86 share to this directory on your machine.  Note: you do
NOT need the subdirectories.
e.g. xcopy m:\mstools \nt\mstools
e.g. xcopy m:\idw \nt\mstools

Set two environment variables:
SET USERNAME=[x86Fre|x86Chk]
SET _NTDRIVE=<your drive>

e.g.
SET USERNAME=x86Chk
SET _NTDRIVE=C:
execute \nt\public\tools\razzle.cmd
cd to the \denali\src directory and type "BUILD"
