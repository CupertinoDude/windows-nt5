EASP directory subtree has to do with Encrypted ASPs.
It contains the following projects:

1) cmd 
    -- Command line application to encrypt/decrypt ASPs

2) comp 
    -- ActiveX server component the implements the
       PageEncryptor object

The above projects use easpcore.cpp and easpcore.h from
standard Denali sources.
