<dl>
<dt>proof by example:</dt>
<dd>    The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it
        contains most of the ideas of the general proof.</dd>

<dt>proof by intimidation:</dt>
<dd>    'Trivial'.</dd>

<dt>proof by vigorous handwaving:</dt>
<dd>    Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.</dd>
</dl>
%%
                        <b>HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 2</b>

<dl>
<dt>proof by cumbersome notation:</dt>
<dd>    Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
        symbols.</dd>

<dt>proof by exhaustion:</dt>
<dd>    An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.</dd>

<dt>proof by omission:</dt>

        'The other 253 cases are analogous'<br>
        '...'</dd>

%%
                        <b>HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 3</b>

<dl>
<dt>proof by obfuscation:</dt>
<dd>    A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless
        syntactically related statements.</dd>

<dt>proof by wishful citation:</dt>
<dd>    The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of
        a theorem from the literature to support his claims.</dd>

<dt>proof by funding:</dt>
<dd>    How could three different government agencies be wrong?</dd>

<dt>proof by eminent authority:</dt>
<dd>    'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP-
        complete.'</dd>
</dl>
%%
                        <b>HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 4</b>

<dl>
<dt>proof by personal communication:</dt>
<dd>    'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete
        [Karp, personal communication].'</dd>

<dt>proof by reduction to the wrong problem:</dt>
<dd>    'To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is
        decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.'</dd>

<dt>proof by reference to inaccessible literature:</dt>
<dd>    The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found
        in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian
        Philological Society, 1883.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>proof by accumulated evidence:</dt>
<dd>    Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.</dd>

<dt>proof by cosmology:</dt>
<dd>    The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or
        meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.</dd>

<dt>proof by mutual reference:</dt>
<dd>    In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in
        reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in
        reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in
        reference A.</dd>

<dt>proof by metaproof:</dt>
<dd>    A method is given to construct the desired proof. The
        correctness of the method is proved by any of these
