 to be RAIDED


Infocomm bug/wish list for 3.0

1.  The caching routines under common should have a way of knowing whether
handle caching has been disabled.   This is useful for knowing when to
enable/disable the CacheScavenger in fcache.cxx
By:  - JohnsonA  4/8/96
Fixed:

2.  The quota is not consistently charged with the size of file
caching objects.
By:  PhilliCh  4/8/96
Fixed:

3.  W3/FTP/possibly other services should use a cached token class explicitely
to store user access tokens. Fix security.cxx such that it gives out
CACHED_TOKEN pointers rather than converting it into HTOKEN
By:  PhilliCh & MuraliK  4/8/96
Fixed:

4.  Improve atq\sched.cxx to use GetTimer() (from svcs\irtl\timer.c) rather
than GetTickCount().

Fixed: Phillich, 4/9/96

5. Split out infocomm\cache\  to make a reusable cache module.
By: MuraliK  4/9/96

6. Split out svcs\w3\server\ssi (Server Side Includes) as a separate ISAPI
dll rather than integrating SSI in the server engine.
By: MuraliK  4/9/96

7. Split out ISAPI Application DLL interface from w3 service engine, to
generate separate piece of standalond code for easy modifications.
By: MuraliK  4/9/96

8. For AtqTransmitFileEx and AtqTransmitFile, we don't look at the
HighPart portion of liBytesInFile.
NOTE: we do not support HighPart in w3 as well ( i.e. we fail the request
if HighPart != 0 )
By: JohnsonA 4/9/96
Fixed:

9. For infocomm, we should find a way of removing the extra thread
in tsvcinfo/isvcinfo waiting for the shutdown event to occur.
By: JohnsonA 4/10/96
Fixed:

10. Use the cached security token in infocomm/services interface. Today we 
 cast the cached object to HANDLE hToken, which will cause confusion in service
 code about what this really is.
