class	CAddon	{
//
//	This class manages files which contains data with the following format : 
//
//	Name<TAB or SPACE>String with Spaces<CRLF>
//
//	Examples of such files are active.txt files and descript.txt files.
//	In these files the 'Name' is the newsgroup name, and the following
//	character contains strings which CNewsGroup objects will reference.
//	(For instance - descript.txt the extra text is the descriptive string provided
//	in response to the list newsgroups command.
//
//	This base class handles memory mapping the file, and handles insert, 
//	deletion and compaction of the data file.  Insertions are appended to the
//	end, there is no attempt to order the data.  Deletions will just overwrite
//	portions of the file with NULL's.  When we compact, we shift all the data
//	around.
//
//	The function LookupFunction() should be overridden by derived classes
//	so as we parse the file they can learn where the content is.
//	The ReadData() and FinishReadData() must be used before any pointer
//	which points into the memory mapping is used, this ensures that 
//	there are not synchronization problems as we compact or grow the file.
