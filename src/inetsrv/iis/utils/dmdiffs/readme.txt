Purpose:
    These are simple tools to produce a summary of changes
    to the file system and the metabase between two states.
    
    To make a snapshot of a state, run 
    
    getit <basename>

    which will generate files <basename>.dir and <basename>.mb 
    in current directory.

    To produce a summary of differences between two states, do
    
    doit <old_snapshot_basename> <new_snapshot_basename>
    
    
    Perl for Win32 can be found, for instance, at
