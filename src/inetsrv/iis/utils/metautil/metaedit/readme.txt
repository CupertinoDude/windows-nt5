Install:

Run the setup program from install\setup.exe

If you already have a previous version of MetaEdit installed you probably can get away
with copying over MetaEdit.exe and MetaUtil.exe and then regsvr32 metautil.dll.


Bugs, issues, etc:

o Backup/Restore not implemented (planned to add under Metabase Menu)
o Find searches the Metabase in natural order.  Since the tree view and list view are 
  sorted, this causes the search to skip around.
o There is no way to view properties under the root node (key = "")
