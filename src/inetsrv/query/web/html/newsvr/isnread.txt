RELEASE NOTES FOR INTERNET NEWS SERVER SAMPLE QUERY FORMS

1. Two new samples have been installed: /samples/search/news1.htm and
   /samples/search/news2.htm.  The former demonstrates both full and
   summary hilighting of news articles.  The latter is a news-centric
   query form.

2. The adminstration of virtual roots has been changed to support
   news roots. /scripts/srchadm/admin.idq and /scripts/srchadm/admin.htx
   have been updated.

3. To enable hit hilighting via webhits.exe you must provide a valid virtual
   path to files in news roots. For every Internet News root, create an
   equivalent Internet Server root with $CiNews prepended.  Examples:

       News             Web
       --------------   ----------------
       <home>           /$CiNews
       /soc             /$CiNews/soc

   READ PERMISSION IS NOT CHECKED ON THESE ROOTS.  In fact, unless you
   desire to share news articles via the web, you should mark the Internet
   Server roots with no permissions.

   Existing news directories have been updated during install.
