# The CiCatalog variable must point to where the catalog (index) files

# These are the columns that are referenced in the .htx files
# when formatting output for each hit.

CiColumns=vpath, path, metavrootused, metavrootauto, metavrootmanual, storagetype

# The CiRestriction is the query.  Here, it's just pass in from the
# form in the .htm file.

# Don't allow more than 300 total hits in the result set.  It can be
# expensive for the serer to allow this value to get too large.

# CiScope is the directory (virtual or real) under which results are

# CiScope, it is not returned in the result set.

# This is the list of property names to use in sorting the results.
# Append [a] or [d] to the property name to specify ascending or
# descending.  Separate keys in multi-key sorts with commas.

# descending, use CiSort=write[a],filesize[d]

# Setting CiForceUseCi to true means that the index is assumed to be
# up to date, so queries that might otherwise force a walk of the
# directory structure (find files older than X), will instead use
# the index and run more quickly.  Of course, that means that the results
# might miss files that match the query.
