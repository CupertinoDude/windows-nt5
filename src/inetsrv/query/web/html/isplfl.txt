; This file is used to specify where every file built by the NT build lab is
; binplaced relative to the root of the distribution point.  If a file is not
; listed, it will end up in the dump directory.
;
; The format is like this:
;
; <imagename>    <class name>
;
; where <imagename> is the filename.ext and <class name> is the directory off the root
; of the distribution point (retail is a placeholder for the root).  If there are multiple
; class names for a single image, use a colon to separate each.
;
; All bits that ship in the NT base product and are installed with winnt32, must have
; a class name of retail.
;
; If you add a new file to the list, please refrain from creating your own special
; section.  Doing so makes it difficult to detect duplicates.  If you're unable to
; add your image due to a collision with an existing name, work it out with the other
; developer.  Options include creating another placefil.txt for your project or using
; the ALT_PROJECT_TARGET macro in your sources file to change the base of the distribution
; point (doing so means your project will not install as part of base NT).
;
;     sort /+17 < placefil.txt > placefil.srt
;
; will generate a list sorted by class name if you want.
