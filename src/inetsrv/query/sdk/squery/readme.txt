Description
===========
  The SQuery sample consists of three scripts that execute using Windows
  Script Host.  VBSQuery is written in VBScript and performs a simple
  query.  JSQuery is a translation of VBSQuery to JScript.  QSample is
  written in VBScript and functions similarly to the C++ sample application
  Simple (QSample) with managing and querying functionality.

User's Guide
============
  * To execute queries using the VBSQuery.vbs or JSQuery.js scripts
      1. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
         sample scripts.
      2. Submit a fixed query by entering, at the command-line prompt,

         cscript vbsquery.vbs
         or
         cscript jsquery.js
         
  * To execute queries using the QSample.vbs script
      1. Open a command window and change the directory to the path of the
         sample scripts.
      2. Formulate a query that you know will succeed.  You need to know
         the query text and, optionally, values for the machine, catalog,
         scope, columns, query language dialect, locale,sort order, and
         other argument (see list below).
      3. Submit a query by entering, at the command-line prompt,

         cscript qsample.vbs <query> [arguments]

         where
         
         <query>         is an Indexing Service query.
         
         and the arguments can optionally include:
         
         /c:<catalog>    is the name of the catalog.
                             Default is SYSTEM.
         /e:<locale>     is ISO locale identifier, e.g. EN-US.
                             Default is system locale.
         /f:(+|-)        + or - specifies forcing use of the index.
                             Default is +.
         /g              specifies forcing a master merge.
         /i:<inputfile>  specifies an input file to read with queries,
                             one per line.
         /j              specifies to return just files in the scope path,
                             and not subdirectories.
         /l:<dialect>    specifies the query language dialect, 1 or 2.
                             Default is 1.
         /m:<machine>    is the name of the computer.
                             Default is the local computer.
         /o:<columns>    is the output column list.  Default is path.
         /p:<scope>      is the scope path of the query, absolute or relative.
         /q              specifies to execute quietly.
                             Display only query results.
         /r:#            is the number of times to repeat the command.
         /s:<sort>       is the sort column list.  Default is none.
                             For example: write[d].  Append [a] for ascending
                             (default) or [d] for descending.
         /t              specifies to display catalog statistics.
         /u              specifies to check if the catalog is up to date.
         /x:<maxhits>    is the maximum number of hits to retrieve.
                             Default is no limit.
         
Programming Notes
=================
  VBSQuery and JSQuery
  --------------------
    The query executed by these scripts is embedded in the script.  The query
    uses the Query Helper API and consists of the following.
     *  Columns = filename, directory, size, write
     *  Query = #filename *.asp
     *  GroupBy = directory[a]
     *  Catalog = system
     *  CiScope = \
     *  CiFlags = DEEP
     *  OptimizeFor = recall,hitcount
     *  AllowEnumeration = True
     *  MaxRecords = 20000

    The JSQuery is a direct translation of the VBSQuery script
    to JScript.  Its output is identical to that of VBSQuery except
    for a difference in the way dates and times are represented.

  QSample.vbs
  -----------
    QSample uses the Query Helper API and is much more general and
    flexible than the VBSQuery and JSQuery scripts.  It also uses
    the Admin Helper API to perform some managing tasks.
