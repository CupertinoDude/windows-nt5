MQASP sample shows how to perform basic queue operations using MSMQ ActiveX components in IIS server 
side scripting with ASP/VBS.

To run the sample:
1. Create a new folder 'msmq' in your InetPub\scripts directory on the machine where II is installed. 
Copy the sample files to that folder. The IIS Server machine must have MSMQ client or server 
installed in order to use MSMQ ActiveX components. It also has to be DS enabled.

2. Use Internet Explorer from any client machine to point to http://<yourservername>/scripts/msmq/default.asp.  
MSMQ does not need to be installed on the machines running the browser.
