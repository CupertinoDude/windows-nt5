There are sevral automatic tests and semi-auto tests (where the test result should be checked manualy).
To install and run the automatic tests follow the instructions ahead.
In the end there is a list of tests which should be manualy performed.

Building the TriggersTest directory: (only on the build machine)
=====================================
Run BuildTests.bat. This will build the TriggersTests tree for installation of the tests.

- TriggersTests
	- ActionTest	
	- CondTest
	- StressTest
	- SystemQTest
	- RuleProcessing


Installing TriggersTests: (on each test machine)
==========================
From the test machine run (under \\"buildmachine"\msmqtrig\src\tests) InstallTests.bat 
with the TriggersTest dir on the build machine as parameter.
e.g (build machine \\yifatp5):
\\yifatp5\rootd\msmqtrig\src\tests\InstallTests.bat \\yifatp5\TriggersTests

This will copy all necessary files for running all tests and register them if needed.


Running the tests:
===================

StressTest:
------------
Creates X queues with Y related triggers and Z rules and sends messages to the queues to activate the triggers.
From \TriggersTest\StressTest run StressTest.bat with the matching command line options.

The test generates Stress1Log.txt - for each queue - with its queue number.
All rules of triggers associated with a specific queue write to the same log file. (message label and its arrive time)



CondTest:
----------
Verifies all conditions work properly.
From \TriggersTest\CondTest run CondTest.bat with the matching command line options.

Look in CondTestDiff.log (generated in \winnt\system32), if "identical" appears - test PASSED SUCCESSFULLY, else (different) FAILED.

NOTES:
-------
- Doesn't test src machine id as condition parameter ( equal/not equal) - should be tested manually



ActionTest:
-----------
Verifies all action parameters are passed properly.
From \TriggersTest\ActionTest run ActionTest.bat with the matching command line options.

Look in ActionTestLog1.txt (or given file name and number) - indicates test passed or failed.

NOTES:
-------
- Doesn't test correlation id.(SendMsg doesn't send value diffrent than null-guid\0)
- Missing - Check action parameters for exe


SystemQTest:
-------------
Verifies MSMQ triggers on system queues works.

Note: you must manually set permissions to read from deadletter and journal for everyone before running the test. (From Message Queueing Properties)
----

From \TriggersTest\SystemQTest run SystemQTest.bat with the matching command line options.

Look in SystemQTestLog.txt , if appears line for SystemQDeadXact, SystemQDeadLetter and SystemQJorunal - test passed


RuleProcessingTest:
------------------
Verifies RuleProcessingStatus as retval from com method works.

Note: This test is semi-manuall
----

From \TriggersTest\RuleProcessingTest run RuleProcessingTest.bat with the matching command line options.


Manual Tests:
==============

MMC triggers snap-in
--------------------
 - dispalying/adding/removing/updating of Local and Remote trigger data. (both in stand-alone mode and as an extention)

Triggers Service
-----------------
- Add/Remove/Update of Trigger
- Add/Remove/Update of Rule
- Enable/Disable Trigger
- Attach/Detach rules
- Order of rules
- Serialized/Non serialized queue. (with 1 or more triggers, including off/on/off/on)
- Conditions - src machine id (all the rest can be automaticaly checked using condtest)
- Action parameters - correlation id (all the rest can be automatically checked using actiontest)
- Several Triggers on the same queue
- Several triggers and sevral queues
- Rules used by sevral triggers
- Deleting a queue with triggers
- Action is invoking Com object (dll, exe, MTS) and EXE

All tests should be performed both on NT5, NT4 and on workgroup
