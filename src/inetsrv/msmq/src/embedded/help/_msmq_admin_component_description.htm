<P>This component includes the Message Queuing administrative tools necessary to manage Message Queuing. </P>

<P>Message Queuing is a messaging infrastructure and a development tool for creating distributed messaging applications for Microsoft Windows operating systems. Applications developed for Message Queuing send messages to queues, which are temporary storage locations, from which messages can proceed to their final destination as conditions permit. Such applications can communicate across heterogeneous networks and can send messages between computers that may be temporarily unable to connect to one another. Message Queuing provides guaranteed message delivery, efficient routing, security, support for sending messages within transactions, and priority-based messaging. Software products with these features are often referred to in the industry as message-queuing software, store-and-forward software, or message-oriented middleware.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>To install the MSMQ Admin component, you must also install the MSMQ C API component.</P>
