Module Name:

    sources.

Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

NOTE:   Commented description of this file is in \nt\bak\bin\sources.tpl

This file relies on the fact that makefil0 in the IDL directory has
already been invoked to build the _i.c file and that makefil0 in this
directory has already built the dsys.c file.
