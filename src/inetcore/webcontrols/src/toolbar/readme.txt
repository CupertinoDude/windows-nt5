The code within \nt\inetcore\webcontrols\src\toolbar is not
the toolbar code that we are planning on using. However, it
should be archived somewhere.
The affected files are: toolbar.htc and toolbar.css

The code within \nt\inetcore\webcontrols\src\tbar
is the code that we will use.
The affected file: toolbar.htc
