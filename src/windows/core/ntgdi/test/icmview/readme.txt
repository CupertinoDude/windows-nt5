ICMVIEW.EXE : ICM capable image viewer

This application uses ICM both inside and outside the DC ICM functions to
manipulate the display and printing of Windows BMP and DIB format images.
Typically, an application would just use one or the other; the preferred and
encouraged method is outside the DC.

To run the application, type "ICMVIEW".  Use File/Open to open images, then use
the secondary mouse button to bring up the properties of the selected image.
