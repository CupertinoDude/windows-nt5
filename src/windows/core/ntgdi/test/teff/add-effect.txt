The following files:
	CTE_GenTexture.h	CTE_GetTexture.cpp
	CTE_GenShape.h		CTE_GenShape.cpp	
	CTE_GenOperator.h	CTE_GenOperator.cpp
are generic definition and implementation files for primitive effects.  Copy the 
files that correspond to the new effect type and add code where necessary.  
For instance, to add a new texture effect called CTE_Fill, the relevant files to 
be copied are CTE_GenTexture.h and CTE_GenTexture.cpp.  The new effect's 
class  name will be CTE_TextureFill (or simply CTE_Fill?).

To add a new effect:
    (1) globally replace GenTexture/GenShape/GenOperator with the effect name,
    (2) add effect-specific data members and access methods (if required),
    (3) implement the copy constructor, 
    (4) implement Dump(),
    (5) implement Apply(),
    (6) add effect-specific operations (if required).

The intention of these files is to reduce the work required to add a new effect.
