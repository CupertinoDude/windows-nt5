Before installing GroupWise Client in this version of Windows, Windows Messaging System must be installed.
Windows Messaging System provides the MAPI components that GroupWise Client requires. Windows Messaging
System may or may not be installed on this Windows system.
If the GroupWise Client Setup does not detect an existing installation of the Windows Messaging System, it attempts to install an earlier version that isn't compatible with this version of Windows. This results in a failed installation for both Windows Messaging and GroupWise Client.
This problem affects GroupWise 5.5 and earlier on this version of Windows.
Novell provides a version of Windows Messaging System that is compatible with this version of Windows on their support site.
