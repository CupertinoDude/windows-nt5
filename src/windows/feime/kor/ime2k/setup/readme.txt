All file under Setup folder are for creating setup files for Office 10. So not shipped for Whistler. Neither will be binplaced.

I added thees files to NT SD for the future in case of delivering IME for non-system apps such as next version Office and backup purpose.
We have been dropped IMEKOR.MSM to Office Team. And build script "Fullbuild.bat" and "incbuild.bat" 
also build stand-alone IME setup for testing.

CLSID.H file contains GUIDs for Office 10, In future these should be modified newer ones.
