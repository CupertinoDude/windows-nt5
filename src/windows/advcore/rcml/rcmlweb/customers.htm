RCML is a new Windows resource file format that is designed to provide access to
more Win32 UI features than existing RC files and solve a number of problems
with existing dialog boxes and the existing resource format, most notable with
localization and UI design. In addition to the new RCML file format, there is an
enhanced version of the DialogBox API that works hand in hand with the RCML file
to make use of the enhanced data it contains.<br> 

<p><SPAN class=section>Clients</SPAN></p>
<P>RCML has been designed to address the specific needs of a well-defined set of 
customers while avoiding the trap of trying to solve everything for everyone. 
The people whose needs RCML does address are: </P>

          <p>Designers have special requirements when it comes to laying out dialogs, here is 
a synopsis of the design process from a designers point of view. </p>
          <li><a href="localizers.htm">Localization</a></li>
          <p>Microsoft spends about $300 million on localizing our applications. Of the 50% 
of that cost that is spent on testing, 70% is taken up by testing and fixing 
cosmetic UI bugs. These are things like the localized text in a control not 
fitting in the space originally provided when the dialog was designed in another 
language. These are hard to track and extremely expensive to fix. More 
importantly, Microsoft has more than 2000 people working on localization (around 
1000 FTE's) and in peak periods such as the 6 months to the Office 2000 release, 
over 3000 people. If the layout of the dialogs was managed correctly, a vast 
amount of this time and effort would be saved.</p>

          <li><a href="developers.htm">WinCE developers</a></li>
          <P>Win32 developers face a number of hurdles that are making Win32 applications 
difficult to develop and achieve the richness of such things as HTML. New 
platform UI advances are not being easily exposed resulting in a lack of 
incentive to move to new versions of the operating system. A lot of the 
functionality being added to the OS today requires the developer to re-write 
their code to take advantage of it.</P>
          
          
          <li><a href="usered.htm">Windows UI Text Team</a></li>
          <P>The Windows UI Text team&nbsp; ensures that all Windows UI text is consistent with other 
Microsoft products, complies with the standards in the Windows interface 
guidelines, and meets localization requirements. UI text writers and editors
          work cooperatively as 
a team with program managers, usability testers, developers, and designers to 
review new product features and to provide feedback on them.

easily and effectively, Microsoft developed Active Accessibility. This set of
technologies improves the way programs and accessibility aids work together,
