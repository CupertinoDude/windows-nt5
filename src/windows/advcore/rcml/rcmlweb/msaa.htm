Subject: RE: RCML Requirements for MSAA</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two main categories of Accessibility-related wishlist items:</p>
<p>(1) General accessibility features</p>
<p>Note that CarlaSo is our contact for this [non-MSAA specific] area.</p>
<p>- Respecting high contrast, keyboard, font preference flags <br>
- (eg. using the system colors instead of the specified styles if the high contrast flag is set.)<br>
- Other cool things (eg. auto generating hotkeys on the fly where not already present)</p>
<p>(2) MSAA-related features</p>
<p>Basic idea is that we want the ability to attach arbitrary
property-name=property-value pairs to controls. Some of the values may be
localizable, others not. Some will be strings, others may be references to other
control IDs.</p>
<p>ACC_NAME = &quot;Name:&quot; // ACC_LABELEDBY = &quot;3&quot; // the label
for this control is the one with an ID of 3.</p>
<p>Some of these properties will correspond to fields in the existing
IAccessible interface: Name, Value, Description, Help, HelpTopic,
KeyboardShortcut</p>
<p>Some of these properties will have no corresponding IAccessible equivalent
(but may be used behind the scenes to generate one of those properties - for
example, LABELEDBY could indicate a control whose text would make a suitable
name for this control.)</p>
<p>This list of properties will be open-ended - we'll define an initial set to
cover most requirements, but more may be added later on as needed. (What's the
best way of getting this type of open-ended flexibility out of RCML?)</p>
<p>Typically you would not need to specify many of these - eg. Name, value,
state etc. would usually come from the control itself anyway - but having this
facility to attach these to specify or override accessibility-related properties
as needed</p>
