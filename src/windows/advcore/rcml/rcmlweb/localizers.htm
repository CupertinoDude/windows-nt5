<p>Microsoft spends about $300 million on localizing our applications. Of the
50% of that cost that is spent on testing, 70% is taken up by testing and fixing
cosmetic UI bugs. These are things like the localized text in a control not
fitting in the space originally provided when the dialog was designed in another
language. These are hard to track and extremely expensive to fix. More
importantly, Microsoft has more than 2000 people working on localization (around
1000 FTE's) and in peak periods such as the 6 months to the Office 2000 release,
over 3000 people. If the layout of the dialogs was managed correctly, a vast
amount of this time and effort would be saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Localization also introduces a class of functional bugs due to words being
localized that should not have been. A good example here is a file open control
containing the file mask “*.doc”. Obviously in this case, the “*.doc”
should not be translated as it will cause programmatic errors.</p>
<p><span class="section">How does RCML address
Localizers needs?</span>
<p>In order to solve the most common localization problem of the localized text
being larger than the original control and thus, being clipped (i.e. text
running off the end), the dialog loader will automatically resize the controls
at load time, to ensure the text fits without clipping. The dialog will be
automatically resized intelligently to allow the expanded controls to fit
without throwing off the rest of the dialog.</p>
<p>Following some research and development work by the internal localization
tools group, the localization teams are providing a schema known as GML
(Globalization Markup Language), which is a set of XML tags that RCML will
support.&nbsp; The GML spec will provide information to the localizing
tools such as what text should be localized and what should not. In addition, it
will be possible to insert comments in with the RCML that are used by the
localizers to make notes on specific areas, which will be ignored by the loader.</p>
<p>On going discussions with the localization teams will ensure that as RCML is
developed and extended such that their needs will be taken in to account as much as
possible.</p>
