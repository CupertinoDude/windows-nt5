 <p>The Windows UI Text team&nbsp; ensures that all Windows UI text is consistent with other
 Microsoft products, complies with the standards in the Windows interface
 guidelines, and meets localization requirements. UI text writers and editors
 work cooperatively as
 a team with program managers, usability testers, developers, and designers to
 review new product features and to provide feedback on them.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Thanks again for meeting with Annette and I, and for giving us a short demo
of RCML. This looks like it could be a great tool for the UI text team for 2001.
The greatest added functionality for us would be the ability to show revision
marks. UI text writers need to have a way to show UI text editors what text
changes they're proposing to make. Likewise, we also need to have a way to show
the feature teams what we're proposing to change, without forcing them to
proofread every line of text to see what's different. We currently mark up
bitmaps so that PMs and devs can see the original UI and our proposed changes.
Here's an example:</p>
<p><img SRC="images/usered.gif" WIDTH="403" HEIGHT="447"></p>
<p>So, for RCML, we'd still need to have a way to show what we're proposing to
change. It might be cool if there was some kind of layering functionality. For
example, the changed text would appear in a different font color, but it would
be easy for the dev to go back to see what was there before. The problem with
visual studio, for example, is that, sure, we can go in and make the text
changes, but there's no way to show the feature team what we've changed, and we
can't go off and make changes without their buyoff. :-) So, we need an easy way
for them to look at our changes and hit the &quot;presto&quot; button if they
accept them so that they can overwrite what's underneath.</p>
