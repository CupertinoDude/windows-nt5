  <blockquote>
    <p>Start to implement the new extended schema, and integrate the generator
    into the DLL - Work is going well here, but we'll not integrate into the DLL
    for M0.</p>
    <p>Work on M0 deliverables : clipping text, and resizable property sheets
    (re-architecture required) - on track for M0.</p>
    <p>Work on Slide deck for first 'big' review - first pass on review done,
    we'll need an hour, so review moved, date TBD.</p>
    <p>Start to convert the RCML schema to use the &quot;XML Schema
    schema&quot;. A more formal schema definition, big customer win.</p>

  <p>Big news is that the Exchange Server (Peter Beinhardt) team loved RCML, and
  they said they'd sign up to be a customer. They asked hard questions, and we
  had the answers. They'll even supply a dev to help with the migration!</p>
  <p>New schema implementation in design stages..</p>
  <p>Met with CWD (consumer windows division) to extol the virtues of using GML.
  Good meeting, they seemed more interested in the features of RCML than GML.
  JeffBog was in attendance, and said Neptune would probably have something
  different to RCML.</p>
  <p>Substitutable text is in (entity replacement). Has partial blessing from
  the XML team, but they're OK given our customer set.</p>
  <p>Work on Slide deck for first 'big' review is progressing.</p>
  <p>Started work on converting the RCML schema doc to use the XML schema schema
  with XSL for rendering - takes a while.</p>
  <p>Did some memory investigation work, nothing looked TOO scary, we're cost
  the application about 80K or so.</p>
  <p>Focussing on M0 (July 8th) deliverables.</p>

<p>Last Week:</p>
<blockquote>
</font></b><font SIZE="2">
<p>Produced concrete dates for code deliverables, M0 July 8th. http://rcml/scheduleupdate.htm</p>
<p>Improved the clipping text (single and multi line) with support for bigger,
smaller font sizes for MSAA.</p>
<p>Complete removal of CString with LPCTSTR done and MSVCRT linkage.</p>
<p>Perf numbers, we continue to clear out the low hanging fruit before we
publish numbers.</p>
<p>Last GML and Text+ meetings were a success, these two teams will own the
localizable strings in RCML.</p>
<p>Had our first pure C customer use our stuff (JulieB), produced good feedback
which we are rolling into our generator and SDK.</p>

<p>Meetings:
<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Met with Text+ and designers about layout systems.&nbsp;
    Some interesting things that we have to make sure to consider:&nbsp; Tibetan
    has big requirements in height (twice as many pixels vertically than we
    currently use).&nbsp; Other problems might occur if we put multiple
    languages in one control (especially Edit)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">Development:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Removal of CString with LPCTSTR - 90% done.</li>
    <li>There were some improvements on the Perf Numbers.</li>
    <li>Removed VT_VARIANT property bag to a leaner key/value pair bag - may be
      used by Text+</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Process</p>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2">Will implement the attribute schema (What attributes
    correspond to what style bits)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Start supporting GML spec</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Get concrete date for deliverables</font></li>

<p>Meetings:
<ul>
  <li>Met with Text+ guys to discuss DrawFormattedText.&nbsp; They need to talk
    with controls to figure out details</li>
  <li>Met with Control plus to determine implementation of RCML.&nbsp; They seem
    excited to help us out and divert some resources to the project</li>
  <li>Met with MSAA team - Very productive meeting.&nbsp; They are very excited
    with RCML and the advatanges it will bring them. They will be sending a list
    of requirements and features that they want RCML to support.&nbsp; As soon
    as we get that, we will post it to this site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Property Sheet support is now in.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We're UNICODE internally.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Did some small perf improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perf numbers are a little bit on the weak side but it is nothing
    unusual.&nbsp; Should be fixed by sometime next week</li>
</ul>

<p>Meetings :&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meet with MUI+ team - good meeting, they will be using RCML for the MUI+ resource format and are hoping to sign up as customers for their dialogs.</li>

  <li>Mihai got ICECap builds so we can start looking at bottlenecks etc!</li>
  <li>STYLE and STYLEEX now support hex (0x...) values.</li>
  <li>Grid can now be painted on the background of the dialog for alignment reasons (pixel only)</li>
  <li>Fixed various bugs - leaks, perf, compiler warnings etc.</li>
  <li>rc2xml.exe is now selfhosted on the rendering engine - it's our first Win32 client.</li>
  <li>Simple version stamps in the exes, and &lt;TESTINFO&gt; element for tracking / testing ease.</li>

Meetings :&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>Money Dev. They have similar functionality, though use the existing RC
    file format. They'd like to move to RCML file format, but support their own
    de-persisting and dialog functionality - as they already have this code
    today.</li>
  <li>Met again with GML (Globalization Markup Language) group (mailto:jsee)
    they are now aware that they should evangelize GML to more groups, and that
    RCML team will support this format for Localized text.</li>
  <li>Met with UIText team. They'd like to have development use RCML format as
    it allows them to do their jobs quicker. In addition they asked for side by
    side diff tools.</li>
  <li>WFC (tools) will not be using RCML as their persistance format.</li>
</ul>
<p>

Development :
<ul>
  <li>Delay Loading of Common controls and GDI+&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Met with XML development team. Since our last meeting, they are moving
    towards more Win32 support for size and speed reasons.</li>
  <li>Caching of GDI+ objects</li>
  <li>Now support <a href="designers.htm">pixel perfect dialog</a> layout and
    GRID's.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process :&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>Meeting notes will now be posted here!</li>
  <li><a href="BUGS/rcml.rdq">RDQ</a> is now published on homepage.&nbsp;</li>
