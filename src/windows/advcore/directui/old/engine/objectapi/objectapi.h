* This file provides a project-wide header that is included in all source
* files specific to this project.  It is similar to a precompiled header,
* but is designed for more rapidly changing headers.
*
* The primary purpose of this file is to determine which DirectUI
* projects this project has direct access to instead of going through public
* API's.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that this is as minimal as possible since
* adding a new project unnecessarily reduces the benefit of project
* partitioning.
