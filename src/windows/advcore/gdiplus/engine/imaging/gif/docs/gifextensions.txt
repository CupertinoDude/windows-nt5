Preface

As you know GIF standard allows multiple images to be stored in a single file which can be played as an animation. These files are called multiple image GIFs, multi-image GIFs, animated GIFs or GIF animations. This faculty was implemented in GIF87a standard. And play speed control faculty was implemented in GIF89a standard. But, GIF89a specification didn't define looping GIF animations which become popular on Web pages. They were defined by Netscape Communications Corporation. 
This page introduces a de facto standard format for the looping GIF animations which was defined by Netscape Communications Corporation for Netscape Navigator 2.0.

The information on this page is not described based on the official information by Netscape but it is described by me (the author of GIF Info) based on Mozilla source code. If you find errors or have suggestions, please contact me. "Yukinori Watanabe" <xyuki@geocities.co.jp> 

NETSCAPE2.0 Application Extension

a. Description.
This block indicates decoders to play back the entire GIF Data Stream iteratively or to wait image randering until its image buffer full. 
Since this block is defined based on the Application Extension, this block is transparent to decoders which don't support this block. Therefore such decoders don't play back the entire GIF Data Stream iteratively. 
This extension was defined for Netscape Navigator 2.0 by Netscape Communications Corporation. Microsoft Corporation implemented this extension into Internet Explorer 3.0.

  NOTE:  The Data Sub-block Sizes of the Netscape Extension Data Sub-blocks
  described here  may not be always fixed values.  Code written based on this
  information should be designed in a flexible way to accommodate any changes
  in the future definition.


i. Extension Introducer
Defines this block as an extension. This field contains the fixed value 0x21. 
 
ii. Application Extension Label
Identifies the block as an Application Extension. This field contains the fixed value 0xFF. 
 
iii. Block Size
Number of bytes in this extension block, following the Block Size field, up to but not including the beginning of the Application Data. This field contains the fixed value 0x0B. 
 
iv. Application Identifier
Sequence of eight printable ASCII characters used to identify the application owning the Application Extension. This field contains the fixed value "NETSCAPE". 
 
v. Application Authentication Code
Sequence of three bytes used to authenticate the Application Identifier. This field contains the fixed value "2.0". 
 
vi. Data Sub-block Size
Number of bytes in this Data Sub-block, following the Data Sub-block Size field, up to but not including the Block Terminator or the next Data Sub-block. The size must be within 1 and 255 bytes. 
 
vii. Netscape Extension Code
Indicates the function of the Netscape Extention Data Sub-block.
Values
Meaning
1
Indicates decoders to play back the entire GIF Data Stream specified number of times. The Loop Count is given in the next Unsigned (16 bits) field.
See the Looping Extension data sub-block.
2
Indicates decoders to wait for specified number of bytes to enter buffer. The Buffering Size is given in the next Unsigned long (32 bits) field.
See the Buffering Extension data sub-block.
0, 3-7
To be defined.
viii. 
 
ix. Loop Count
Indicates the number of iterations the loop should be executed.
Values
Meaning
0
Indicates the loop is infinite.
1 .. 0xFFFF
Indicates the number of iterations the loop should be executed.
x. 
Note: Netscape Navigator 2.x ignores this values and the loop is infinite. This values are supported by Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or later. 
 
xi. Buffering Size
Indicates the number of bytes that the GIF Data Stream should be buffered before the graphics rendering process is started. 
 
xii. Block Terminator
This zero-length data block marks the end of the Application Extension Block. 
 
d. Extensions and Scope.
The scope of the Looping Extension is the entire GIF Data Stream. The scope of the Buffering Extension is none. This block cannot be modified by any extension. 
e. Recommendations.
The Looping Extension must appear immediately after the Global Color Table. If there is no Global Color Table in the GIF Data Stream, this block must appear immediately after the Logical Screen Descriptor. It means that the Looping Extension must appear before any Graphic-Rendering Block appears. 
The Buffering Extension may appear at any place which the Application Extension can appear. 
If the Looping Extension is used, the Graphic Control Extensions should not be omitted to specify the Delay Time for each Graphic-Rendering Blocks. 

ANIMEXTS1.0 Application Extension

This extension is the same format that both the Application Identifier ("NETSCAPE") and the Application Authentication Code ("2.0") of the NETSCAPE2.0 Application Extension are replaced by "ANIMEXTS" and "1.0". 
This extension is supported by Netscape Navigator 2.0 or later. Microsoft Internet Explorer doesn't support this extension (the current version is 4.0x).
