Split the encoder and decoder apart.  Currently they are both partially integrated in the GpGifCodec class but they should be in separate classes because they don't share much functionality.

saucer1a.gif has a few lines of garbage data at the bottom of the first frame and anispark.gif has garbage all over it.  I think that these two are caused by the same problem having to do with restoring the background after a frame is complete.

Non-blocking decode needs to be implemented.

If the client asks for a specified frame and it is the last one that was decoded then that frame is already in the cache.  Right now the decoder re-decodes all of the frames up to that point to get to the current frame.

Figure out if the delay needs to be set to a minimum value when decoding animated gifs.

Calculate pixelaspect in encode.

Encoder needs to handle animation and alpha.
Encoder should only use gif89 when nescessary.
Encoding with interlacing does not work nor is there a way to specify it when encoding.
