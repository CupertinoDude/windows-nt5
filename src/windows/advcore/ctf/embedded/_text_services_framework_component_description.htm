<P>Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework (TSF) is a Component Object Model (COM)-based system service that provides a simple and scalable framework for the delivery of advanced text input and natural language technologies. TSF can be enabled in applications, or as TSF Text Services. TSF Text Services provide multi-language support and deliver text services such as keyboard input service, handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and spelling-checker and grammar-checker services. </P>

<P>Text Services Framework is a device-independent, language-neutral, and extensible system for text delivery and language technologies. TSF-enabled applications can access any text service that supports TSF. </P>

<P>Text Services Framework includes the following parts:

<UL type="disc">

	<LI>TSF provides an interface between TSF Text Services and a TSF-enabled application. In addition to accepting input from TSF Text Services, TSF also responds to changes within the document. This enables additional text services. </li>
