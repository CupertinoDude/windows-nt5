* Description:
* Public.h contains a list of definitions that are exposed and available
* outside this project.  Any other DirectUser project that wishes to use
* these services directly instead of going through public API's can include
* a corresponding [Project]P.h available in the \inc directory.  
* 
* Definitions that are not exposed through this file are considered project 
* specific implementation details and should not used in other projects.
