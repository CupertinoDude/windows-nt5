<P>The Generic Packet Classifier (GPC) is a network component that consolidates packet-classification functionality from other network components into a central facility. It performs packet classification for other network drivers based on declarative classification specifications established by those drivers. While this component prevents unrelated drivers from interfering with each other’s classifications, it also provides a semi-structured communication channel enabling drivers to share packet-related information. This centralized classification system affords engineering efficiencies in design and maintenance, and it improves performance by eliminating redundant classifications of separate classifiers. In contrast to most previous research in packet classification, which dealt primarily with algorithmic issues, the GPC is a complete packet-classification system. Key features of this system include protocol templates supporting virtually any network protocol, prioritized and hierarchical wildcard patterns providing specification flexibility, and classification handles sharing classification results among unrelated drivers with differing classification specifications.</P>
