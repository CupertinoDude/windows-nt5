This directory contains NetShell extensions for QoS (Bug #26301). This file explains how to merge this with the 
code base.

 - This consists of two parts - 
       * a protocol portion. This is the code that executes the routing protocol. All related files are stored
         under qos-protocol. 

       * a netshell portion. This is the code that handles the UI, plumbs the registry, etc. All related files are 
         stored under qos-netshell.

 - copy all files under qos-protocol to %SDXROOT%\net\rras\ip\qos.

 - merge the changes under qos-netshell with the current changes in %SDXROOT%\net\rras\netsh\ip\protocols. The files
   in this directory have been based on an existing version of netshell. This is recorded in sdchanges.txt. Each file
   in this directory will have to be merged with the appropriate version in sdchanges.txt
    
   For eg:

        sdchanges.txt has ippromon.c#5. This means that the ippromon.c in this directory was based on version #5
        of ippromon.c in the net code base.

 - merge .\routprot.w with routprot.w in \nt\net\published\inc directory. The routprot.w in this dir was based of 
   routprot.w#1.

 - Add the ipqosrm.h to \nt\net\rras\inc

 - build the protocol and netshell extensions

 - Load the qosdiff.reg file before running netshell. This has to be moved to an appropriate inf.

 - party on.
