Notes:

1. The reg file qos.reg has to be created in order to use this extension. For now, run regedit qos.reg, but later on 
   move it to the correct inf.

2. Fix all the qos specific help messages to be more compatible with existing ones. eg:
   add dsrule ? (prints only the usage). 

   If you look at other modules like rip, it prints usage, detailed explanation, and examples. Need PM work
   for this.
