SYNOPSIS: Provides direct access to tcpip.sys (NT50) and vtcp.vxd/vip.vxd (Memphis/Win95)

Builds: iphlpapi.dll
        SET BLD_FOR_NT4=1 to build for NT 4.0

        SET BLD_FOR_WIN95=1 to build for Win95.

        SET BLD_FOR_MEMPHIS=1 to build for memphis, else NT.
        Also, for Memphis and Win95 
           SET ROOT to be the root of your Memphis enlistment. (It looks for some header files there).
        Can't have one dll, as some structs have ifdefs in them.

See:  public\sdk\inc\iprtrmib.h for all mib struct defns.

Make sure you don't have a dup/different/older header in:
      net\routing\inc\

Chicago:
    We use Wsock32:WsControl to reach the stack in some cases.
    For other cases we open the handle to VIP.vxd and call IOCTL directly.
