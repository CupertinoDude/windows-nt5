net/atm
    this sub-project contains implementation of ATM-related technologies.
    this includes the lane, rawwan, and uni drivers, atm samples, as well as
    the winsock2 service provider which exposes rawwan to winsock clients.

    oldnt:ntos/inc/atm.h moved to newnt:net/atm/genx/inc/atm.w because this
    file is published to the DDK.  it was given a .w extension so that it
    can be run through the "cleansing" process (which takes care of copyright
    headers, etc) before being published.

    oldnt:ntos/inc/atm40.h moved to newnt:net/atm/inc.

    oldnt:inc/laneinfo.h moved to newnt:net/inc.  it is used by net/config
    so it needs visibility outside of net/atm.  recommend it be renamed
    with an atm prefix -- e.g. atmlanep.h

    oldnt:inc/rawanuser.h moved to netnt:net/atm/inc since the service
    provider implemnetation now lives under net/atm.  this header no longer
    needs to have global visibility because it is only included by files
    under net/atm.

    oldnt:inc/ws2atmsp.h moved to newnt:net/atm/inc since the service
    provider implementation now lives under net/atm.  this header no longer
    needs to have global visibility because it is only included by files
    under net/atm.

net/dlc
    this sub-project builds the DLC driver as well as the user mode api.

    oldnt:net/dlc moved to newnt:net/dlc/api
    oldnt:ntos/dlc moved to newnt:net/dlc/driver

net/ndis
    this sub-project contains the implementation of ndis.sys.  it specifically
    DOES NOT contain any and all ndis miniports.  most ndis drivers for OEM
    hardware have moved to the Drivers project.

    oldnt:inc/ndispnp.h moved to newnt:net/ndis/genx/inc because this file
    is published internally for other projects to use.  it was given a .w
    extension so that it can be run through the "cleansing" process.

    oldnt:ntos/inc/ndis*.h moved to newnt:net/ndis/sys because these headers
    were only included by code under net/ndis/sys.  (Except for ndiswah.h
    which moved to newnt:net/inc.)

net/sfm
    this sub-project contains the implementation of Services for Macintosh

    rules.mk files were not brought over since they relied on the outdated
    net\ui project.

net/tcpip
    this sub-project contains the implementation of TCP/IP, it's command-line
    utilities, APIs, and services.

    /apis     - user-mode programattic APIs expsosed via DLL.
    /commands - command line utitlies that ship with the product.
    /driver   - tcpip.sys
    /services - TCP/IP services (e.g. RIP Listener, Echo, Chargen, TFTP, etc.)
    /tools    - Internal tools and test programs that do not ship.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/trace (trace.dll) was dropped.  rtutils.dll exports
    the same functionality.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/relay (relay.dll and router.exe) was dropped.
    this is the DHCP relay agent which is no longer standalone.
    it's functionality is now provided by rras.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/routetab (routetab.dll) was dropped.  iphlpapi.dll
    exports the same functionality for NT5.  Win9x shares this source, so it
    may be that we need to bring it over to newnt eventually.

    oldnt:sockets/tcpcmd/winipcfg was dropped.  It is not listed in layout.inf
    so it seems it is not shipped.  (Althought I think it is shipped in
    Windows 9x.)

net/tdi
    this sub-project contains the implementation of tdi.sys.  it specifically
    DOES NOT contain any and all tdi providers.

    oldnt:inc/tdi*.h moved to newnt:newnt/tdi/genx/inc/tdi*.w since
    they are published internally to NT.
