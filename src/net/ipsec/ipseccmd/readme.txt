IPSEC POLICY CONFIGURATION COMMAND LINE TOOL: "IPSECCMD"
by Randy Ramig (RandyRam@Microsoft.com)
and Dennis Kalinichenko (DKalin@Microsoft.com)

This tool is used to configure IP Security policies in the Directory
Service, or in a local or remote registry.  It does everything that the
IP Security MMC snap-in does, and is even modeled after the snap-in.

It can also query the IPSec Security Policies Database (SPD).

No regkeys required

The tool will NOT be localized.
