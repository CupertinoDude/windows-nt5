<P>Connection Manager, the Connection Manager Administration Kit, and Connection Point Services are a family of applicationsthat enable a network administrator to create, distribute, and update pre-configured dial-up and Virtual Private Network (VPN) remote access connections. The managed connection can be distributed as a self-installing executable, called a service profile, which is compatible with all versions of Microsoft Windows.</P>

<P>Connection Point Services (CPS) is comprised of two components, Phone Book Administrator (PBA) and Phone Book Service (PBS). PBA allows users to create custom phone books, and is available through the Valueadd folder on the Microsoft Windows CD. The PBS component allows users to automatically distribute and update custom phone books. These phone books contain one or more Point of Presence (POP) entries, with each POP supplying a telephone number that provides dial-up access to an Internet access point. The phone books provide users with complete POP information allowing them to connect to different Internet access points rather than being restricted to a single POP while traveling. Without the ability to update phone books, a task PBS handles automatically in conjunction with Connection Manager, users would have to contact technical support to be informed of changes in POP information and to reconfigure their client dialer software. Phone Book Service is a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) extension that runs on Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or later (with IIS). Phone Book Service automatically checks subscribers' or corporate employees' current phone books and, if necessary, downloads a phone book update. </P>
