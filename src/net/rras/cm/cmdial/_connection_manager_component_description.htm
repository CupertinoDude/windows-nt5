<P>Connection Manager, the Connection Manager Administration Kit, and Connection Point Services are a family of products which enable a network administrator to create, distribute, and update preconfigured dial-up and Virtual Private Network (VPN) remote access connections. The managed connection can be distributed as a self-installing executable, called a service profile, which is compatible with all versions of Microsoft Windows. </P>

<P>The Connection Manager component is a managed remote access client. Its behavior is controlled by the settings and custom actions defined in the service profile.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>The Connection Manager component has no configuration requirements for basic operation. All necessary configuration data is included in the service profile that was generated by the network administrator using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK). CMAK is an optional component in the server family release, and in the Administrative Tools Pack for the professional release.</P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>Detailed information on the Connection Manager suite of programs is available through Help and Support Services in the server family release. Sample code for a custom action is available through the software development kit (SDK).</P>
