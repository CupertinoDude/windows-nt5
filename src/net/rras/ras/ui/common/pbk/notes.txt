Notes on phonebook changes for NT5/Connections
----------------------------------------------

PBK.LIB is a private static library shared by RASDLG.DLL, RASAPI32.DLL, and
RASMON.EXE.  It's purpose is to encapsulate phonebook file manipulation,
presenting an easy to handle linked-list-of-phonebook-entry structures to the
caller along with appropriate helper routines.  The library provides a finer
granularity of control than the public Win32 RasGetEntryProperties API which
depends on this library.

PBK.LIB has existed for several versions of the product.  It includes code to
automatically upgrade entries from previous versions on the fly.  Converting
them to the current format when read, and writing them in the current format
when written.  This will carry forward to Connections.

Following is a summary of conversions from NT4 to NT5/Connections:

    * "Guid" is generated and assigned to each entry on creation.  Upgrade
      adds the Guid if it doesn't exist.

    * AreaCode, CountryCode, CountryID, and UseDialingRules are now associated
      with each individual phone number instead of one for the set.  This
      requires changes to the separate phonenum.lib and possibly to RASAPI32.
      Upgrade will duplicate any existing single setting for each alternate
      number.

    * Comments are now associated with each individual phone number instead of
      one Description for the entry.  Upgrade will associate any existing
      Description with the first phone number.

    * New "SharedPhoneNumbers" flag identifies whether phone number for first
      link is same as all subsequent links.  For RASAPI32's convenience, the
      phone numbers will be written to subsequent links anyway, but this flag
      eliminates the need to compare lists of phone numbers each time the
      entry is read, and returns user to what he entered in a case where he
      explicitly enters the same phone numbers for each device.  Upgrade will
      calculate the value of the flag once and it will be maintained by the
      UI.

    * New "ShowMonitorIconInTaskbar", "PreviewUserPw", "PreviewPhoneNumber"
      and "DisplayProgress" flags per UI prototype.  Upgrade will set the
      flags according to the corresponding global user preference settings.
      They will thereafter have fixed defaults.

    * New "TryNextAlternateOnFail" flags per device.  RASAPI must provide the
      functionality.

    * AR_Custom bit added to AuthRestrictions for EAP.

    * DE_Ipsec* codes added.  Old 'DE_Weak' renamed DE_Mppe40bit.  Old
      'DE_Strong' renamed 'DE_Mppe128bit'.

    * dwScriptMode is replaced with fScriptXxx and fScriptXxxTerminal flags.
      This is because the UI now gives user control over whether the terminal
      window appears with the script running.  This used to occur always on
      "after" scripts and never on "before" scripts.

    * New "PrerequisiteEntry" key storing name of WAN entry VPN depends on for
      double dialing.

    * On upgrade of old entries, "OverridePref" bits for redial
      attepts/seconds, idle disconnect seconds, and redial on link failure are
      set, if clear, and the field value set to the user preference settings.

    * Port/Device

        TAPI tries to be a device-centric model, while RASMAN is a
        port-centric model.  In NT4 the phonebook in port-centric.  While the
        NT5/Connections UI is device-centric, i.e. port names are no longer
        displayed *sigh*, the phonebook will remain as in NT4 with regard to
        port/device handling EXCEPT that the lookup of the PBPORT associated
        with a pair of Port/Device keys will be by Device, rather than by
        Port.

        Regarding ISDN B-channel naming, the NT5/Connections UI will not
        distinguish between two B-channels by port name as was done in the
        past.  All B-channels on the same adapter will have the same device
        name.

        RASMAN is the one responsible for mapping ISDN B-channel ports to any
        available ISDN B-channel, i.e. ignoring the explicit ISDNx port
        written in the phonebook.

    * MXS modems are retired.  Any MXS modem entries are assigned to first
      Unimodem port.

    In general each section contains subsections delimited by
    MEDIA=<something> and DEVICE=<something> lines.  There can be any number
    of DEVICE subsections.  There can be multiple MEDIA/DEVICE sets where the
    position of the set determines it's sub-entry index, the first being 1,
    the second 2, etc.

    For serial media, the program currently expects 1 to 4 DEVICE subsections,
    representing a preconnect switch, modem, X.25 PAD, and postconnect switch.

    For ISDN media, the program expects exactly 1 DEVICE subsection.  Note
    that ISDN is now identical to the "other" case.

    For X.25 media, the program expects exactly 1 DEVICE subsection.

    MEDIA=x25                       ;same
    Port=<port-name>                ;same

    UserData=<userdata>             ;same
    Facilities=<facilities>         ;same

    For other media, the program expects exactly one DEVICE subsection with
    device name matching the media.  "Other" media and devices are created for
    entries assigned to all non-serial medias including ISDN which now matches
    the rules for "other".

    MEDIA=<media>                   ;same
    Port=<port-name>                ;same
    Device=<device-name>            ;same

    CountryID=<id>                  ;New

    CountryID=<id>                  ;New
    CountryCode=<country-code>      ;New
    UseDialingRules=<1/0>           ;New

    LastSelectedPhone=<index>       ;New
    PromoteAlternates=<1/0>         ;same
    TryNextPhoneNumberOnFail=<1/0>  ;New

    The phonebook also supports the concept of "custom" entries, i.e. entries
    that fit the MEDIA followed by DEVICE subsection rules but which do not
    include certain expected key fields.  A custom entry is not editable with
    the UI, but may be chosen for connection.  This gives us a story for new
    drivers added by 3rd parties or after release and not yet fully supported
    in the UI. (NOTE: Support for this may be dropped in RAS API)




------------------------------------------------
Notes on conversion from NT3.51 PBENGINE for NT4
------------------------------------------------

This library is a reworking of the PBENGINE.LIB shared by the NT 3.51
RASPHONE.EXE and RASAPI32.DLL.  It's purpose is to encapsulate phonebook file
manipulation, presenting an easy to handle linked-list-of-phonebook-entry
structures to the caller along with appropriate helper routines.


Conversions:

    * Becomes strictly Win32 for increased portability.
        * Replace CRT calls with Win32 where possible.
            Exceptions: qsort, ltoa
        * Eliminate CRT string function usage on all non-numeric strings.
        * Eliminate BLT usage.

    * Becomes multi-thread-safe.  RASDLG can be called from multiple threads
      in a process so the use of global state information, like 'Pbdata' is
      eliminated in favor of returned context blocks.  Further, index
      references into global device lists previously read once at
      initialization are removed, i.e. everything becomes "look up by name"
      when needed.  This will be needed for plug-n-play later anyway.
      (Callers must make similar adjustment)

    * Upper level now uses TCHARs rather than CHARs, where UNICODE is built
      for NT.  The actual file is still written out in MB ANSI using
      RASFIL32.DLL and RASMAN is still ANSI.  This change confines
      UNICODE->ANSI translations to this one thin layer (specifically the
      StrDupAFromT/TFromA routines) simplifying a possible UI port back to
      W95.  The .PBK file itself could be UNICODE and be editable with
      notepad.exe, but that would be a change to the shared RASFIL32.DLL and
      is currently judged "not worth it".

    * Uses new RTUTIL.DLL tracing instead of old "sdebug" style.

    * Built in upgrade of NT 3.51 phonebooks.

    * Explicit "Any <device>" concept is dropped.  It's all implicit now based
      on the type of the selected "preferred" device.  This change requested
      by Gibbs who claims "any port" is extremely expensive in DDM.  (This is
      questionable and will want to watch the reaction carefully.  For
      example, this is a problem for stress scripts?)

    * VALUE_* changed to prefixes and INDEX_No* changed to *_None to associate
      these values more clearly with a set of values.

    * Modem connect response deleted as this is not available from TAPI.

    * PBENTRY: Now contains a list of PBLINK rather than built-in "single
      link".  See below for old field mappings.

    * PBPORT: Modem specific fields only used for MXS support as this are part
      of the new TAPI device blob for Unimodem.

    * PBLINK contains all multi-linkable information, including the new TAPI
      device blob.

    * PBGLOBALS: Global settings are no longer associated with each phonebook
      file but are stored in the CURRENT_USER registry.  They should now be
      read and written separately from the phonebook using the new
      Get/SetUserPreferences calls which phonebook-related enough to be
      provided in pbk.lib.  For the most part, PBGLOBALS->PBUSER.

      Prefix/suffix settings within the phonebook are dropped.  These may be
      implemented in the HKCU preferences.  Note the TAPI location settings
      now optionally handle this functionality.

    * USERDATA, Get/SetRasUserData calls, and CloseFailedLinkPort call are no
      longer in the phonebook library.  These were in pbengine.lib only so
      RASPHONE could figure out which connected entries were actually dialed
      by RASAPI32 to CloseFailedLinkPorts and figure out which ports were
      disconnected due to "link failure" for redial.  These issues must be
      handled by RASMAN/RASAUTO in new model.  If RASAPI engine is moved into
      RASMAN, the USERDATA info can simply be fields in RASCONNCB.

    * The BPS lists are dropped, since they are now provided in the TAPI
      device blob.  For MXS, BPS list is moved into the UI which will display
      an unknown value at the end of it's standard list if encountered.


Port/Device

    TAPI tries to be a device-centric model, while RASMAN is a port-centric
    model.

    RASMAN will return the TAPI device ID for each RASMAN port.  A device ID
    of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates an MXS modem port.  In this case, the port name is
    guaranteed to be unique, but the device name is not (old behavior).  When
    the device ID is not 0xFFFFFFFF, the device name is guaranteed to be
    unique, but the port name is not (because it may not be available).

    How port and device in a phonebook entry are updated/converted:

        If the entry has a "Port" key, it is an old format entry or a new
        format MXS entry.  With these entries, an unconfigured port is
        converted to the first configured port of the same type.  If there is
        no port of the same type the entry is made an "unknown" device with
        the original port name.  Note that "any port" is caught and converted
        by the above rule.

        If the entry has a "PreferredDevice" key it is a new format non-MXS
        entry with no "Port" field.  With these entries, an unconfigured
        device is not converted.  This is in anticipation of Plug-n-Play where
        such conversion is not desirable.

        The UI must disallow "Configure" on unknown or unconfigured devices.

        Note that RasDial will search for the selected "port" or "device"
        first, but if not found will go on and try other ports of the selected
        ports type.  Unimodem and MXS are both tried for "modem" type.  The
        API will apply the blob or the MXS modem settings only to the
        preferred device, not to alternates.

        Old phonebook test cases:

            * Specifies configured MXS port

                - Shows "device (port)" and works as before except tries other
                  modems on open failure

            * Specifies "any modem" port

                - Shows "1st-modem-device (first-modem-port)" and works as
                  before.

                - If no modem ports, shows "unavailable device (Any modem)"
                  and dial attempt fails with "PORT_NOT_FOUND", which is
                  essentially also working as before.

            * Specifies existing unimodem port

                - Shows "device (port)" or "device" and dials the port first
                  trying other unimodem ports on open failure.


Organization:

    The files are organized similar to pbengine.lib where...

        <ras>\ui\common\inc\pbengine.h-><ras>\ui\inc\pbk.h

        Upper level routines and general utilities:
            pbengine.c->pbk.c
            pbengin2.c->pbk.c

        RasMan packaging routines:
            pbrasman.c->rasman.c =
            pbrasma2.c->rasman.c

        Convert list<->file routines and utilities:
            pbfile.c->file.c
            pbfile2.c->file.c

        pbkp.h is added for private library definitions.

    The "2" files were the basic routines needed by only RASAPI32.  With the
    inclusion of the phonebook editing APIs this distinction is much less
    significant and has been dropped.

    In general each section contains subsections delimited by
    MEDIA=<something> and DEVICE=<something> lines.  In pbengine.lib, there
    MUST be exactly one MEDIA subsection and it must be the first subsection
    of the section.  There can be any number of DEVICE subsections.  In
    pbk.lib, there can be multiple MEDIA/DEVICE sets where the position of the
    set determines it's sub-entry index, the first being 1, the second 2, etc.

    For serial media, the program currently expects 1 to 4 DEVICE subsections,
    representing a preconnect switch, modem, X.25 PAD, and postconnect switch.
    Following is a full entry:

    MEDIA=serial                    ;same
    Port=<port-name>                ;No longer set to "Any modem"

    X25Address=<X121address>        ;same
    UserData=<userdata>             ;same
    Facilities=<facilities>         ;same

    DEVICE=switch                   ;same
    Type=<switchname or Terminal>   ;Switchname can be path

    For ISDN media, the program expects exactly 1 DEVICE subsection.  Note
    that ISDN is now identical to the "other" case.

    MEDIA=isdn                      ;same
    Port=<port-name>                ;No longer set to "Any ISDN"
    Device=<device-name>            ;New, not passed to RASMAN

    DEVICE=isdn                     ;same
    PhoneNumber=<phonenumber1>      ;same
    PhoneNumber=<phonenumber2>      ;same
    PhoneNumber=<phonenumberN>      ;same
    PromoteAlternates=<1/0>         ;New, not passed to RASMAN
    LineType=<0/1/2>                ;same
    Fallback=<1/0>                  ;same
    EnableCompression=<1/0>         ;For old protocol only
    ChannelAggregation=<channels>   ;For old protocol only

    For X.25 media, the program expects exactly 1 DEVICE subsection.

    MEDIA=x25                       ;same
    Port=<port-name>                ;No longer set to "Any X25"
    Device=<device-name>            ;New, not passed to RASMAN

    DEVICE=x25                      ;same
    X25Address=<X121address>        ;same
    UserData=<userdata>             ;same
    Facilities=<facilities>         ;same

    For other media, the program expects exactly one DEVICE subsection with
    device name matching the media.  "Other" media and devices are created for
    entries assigned to all non-serial medias including ISDN which now matches
    the rules for "other".

    MEDIA=<media>                   ;same
    Port=<port-name>                ;same
    Device=<device-name>            ;New, not passed to RASMAN

    DEVICE=<media>                  ;same
    PhoneNumber=<phonenumber1>      ;same
    PhoneNumber=<phonenumber2>      ;same
    PhoneNumber=<phonenumberN>      ;same
    PromoteAlternates=<1/0>         ;New, not passed to RASMAN

    The phonebook also supports the concept of "custom" entries, i.e. entries
    that fit the MEDIA followed by DEVICE subsection rules but which do not
    include certain expected key fields.  A custom entry is not editable with
    the UI, but may be chosen for connection.  This gives us a story for new
    drivers added by 3rd parties or after release and not yet fully supported
    in the UI. (NOTE: This may be dropped in RAS API)

    (*) Parameter changes internally to use new set-descriptive constants
        rather than VALUE_*.
