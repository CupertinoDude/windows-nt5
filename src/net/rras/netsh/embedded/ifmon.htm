<P>Netsh, also called NetShell or Network Shell, is a scriptable, command-line based tool that configures and monitors many Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Remote Access Service (RAS) and routing network services. A Netsh context is a state in which Netsh accepts commands related to a specific set of functions. Each Netsh context contains the features for managing a specific related set of networking functions. You can change to other contexts by typing the name of a context. Ifmon.exe is used to add an interface to a router and enable or disable it. It is also used to add an Internet Protocol (IP) address, or to configure Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) and Domain Name System (DNS) server addresses on an interface.</P>
