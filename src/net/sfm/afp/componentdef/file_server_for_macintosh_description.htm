<P>
A computer running Windows with File Server for Macintosh can store files so that users of both x86-based and Macintosh computers can gain access to them. Users of x86-based computers (including users of the MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT Workstation, Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, and future Windows operating systems) look for shared files in a shared folder on the computer running Whistler Server. Macintosh users look for shared files in the same folder; however, they see the folder as a volume, with familiar folders and files.
