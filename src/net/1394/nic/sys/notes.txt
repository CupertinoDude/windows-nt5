    First ntc checkin.  

            Outstanding nic issues - Media connect/ disconnect
    
            Removing timers from the recv code

10/26/99

	Added packet logging code. This can be activated by the PKT_LOG define

	Added Spin Lock debugging. This is currently used by reassembly structures only.

  For the reassembly structs-  garbage collection is performed in the following 
  manner. Whenever a reassembly is invalidated, it marks the reassembly 
  structure as dirty/ Every n seconds, the garbage collector comes around and 
  looks for reassmbly structs that need to aborted/freed. It pops them from the 
  remote node list and frees them.

  The only exception is in the remove remote node code path, Where  the 
  reassemblies are popped out of the list and freed

   The bus driver does retry to send packets that have not been acknowledged.
   This causes fragments to arrive out of order

	An out of order packet can be inserted into the beginning ,end or middle of 
	an existing chain. FragTable in the REassembly structure is used to find
	the correct position

	


  To add wmi":
    add mof to sources -done
    check on makefile.inc and .rc file   - done
    define custom Oids - done 
    Add Oids To Supported Oids - done

	define a structure like this :

Adding Ethernet support :

Requests come down MpCoRequest, ICS calls on CLess Send handlers


Multichannel - Use ChannelVCs for now and allocate resources when the Oid 
comes down

In the bridge code path, it is possible for us to Load the ARP1394 Driver 
in the middle of a request. As part of its initialization, the arp module will
send requests down which do not get to us because NDIS has blocked all requests 
by setting the fMiniport_ProcessingRequest
