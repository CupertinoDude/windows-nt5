FireEvent

Parameters:

    IN MSPEVENTITEM * pEventItem pointer to the structure that describes the 
    event. all the pointers contained in the structure must be addreffed by 
    the caller, and then released by the caller if FireEvent fails

    FireEvent makes a (shallow) copy of the structure, so the caller can 
    delete the structure when the function returns


Returns:
    S_OK - every thing was OK
    E_FAIL & other - something was wrong

Description:
  This method is called by the dynamic terminals to 
  signal a new event
