 * Function   : RTCPxmitInterval
 * Description: Calculate the RTCP transmission interval
 * 
 * Input :	members:	Estimated number of session members including 
 *						ourselves. On the initial call, should be 1.
 *
 *			senders:	Number of active senders since last report, known from
 *						construction of receiver reports for this packet. 
 *						Includes ourselves if we sent.
 *
 *			rtcpBw:		The target RTCP bandwidth, ie, the total Bw that will 
 *						be used by RTCP by all members of this session, in 
 *						bytes per seconds. Should be 5% of the session Bw.
 *
 *			weSent:		True if we've sent data during the last two RTCP 
 *						intervals. If TRUE, the compound RTCP packet just
 *						sent contained an SR packet.
 *
 *			packetSize:	Size of the RTCP packet just sent, in bytes, including
 *						network encapsulation, eg 28 bytes for UDP over IP.
 *
 *			*avgRtcpSize: Estimator to RTCP packet size, initialized and 
 *						 updated by this function for the packet just sent.
 *
 *			initial:	Initial transmission flag.
 *
 * Return: 		Interval time before the next transmission in msec.
