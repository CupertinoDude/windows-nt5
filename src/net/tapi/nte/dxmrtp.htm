<P>This component implements several Microsoft DirectShow filters used to stream audio and video data. This component includes filters for encoding and decoding audio and video, as well as filters for sending or receiving audio and video packets using Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The receiving network filter will also demultiplex the incoming packets. The network filters use the Generic Quality of Service (GQOS) application programming interface (API) to provide Quality of Service (QOS) reservations and CryptoAPI to provide decryption and encryption of the audio and video streams. </P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>This component is only configured through its APIs, which are internally used only by confmsp.dll, h323msp.dll, and rtcdll.dll, as well as some test applications. </P>

<H1>Special Notes</H1>

<P>Although they are DirectShow filters, the filters provided by this component cannot be used together with other DirectShow filters because of the particular requirements they have and because of some implemented specificities. </P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>The files describing the APIs to configure the DirectShow filters can be found at %SDXROOT%\net\tapi\skywalker\filters\doc.</P>
