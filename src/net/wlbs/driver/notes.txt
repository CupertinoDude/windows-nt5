12/11/00 JosephJ Fix for #23727
    23727   wlbs drain all command should return an error message
    if no port rules exist.

    The problem (if you can call it that) is that if there are NO user-specified
    port rules, we treat port-specific operations directed to "ALL" ports as
    successful. These commands are start,stop, drain and set (adjust weights).
    Fix is for Load_port_change to return IOCTL_CVY_NOT_FOUND in this case.
    Note that  Load_port_change does some special casing for
    IOCTL_CVY_CLUSTER_DRAIN and IOCTL_CVY_CLUSTER_PLUG -- it includes
    the default port rule.
