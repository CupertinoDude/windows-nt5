<P>Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable transport protocol for applications that require ordered or unordered, duplicate-free multicast data delivery from multiple sources to multiple receivers. PGM is specifically intended as a workable solution for multicast applications with basic reliability requirements rather than as comprehensive solution for multicast applications with sophisticated ordering, agreement, and robustness requirements. Its central goal is simplicity of operation with due regard for scalability and network efficiency. </P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>Currently this component can only be used by Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ), which is responsible for configuring the component appropriately. </P>
