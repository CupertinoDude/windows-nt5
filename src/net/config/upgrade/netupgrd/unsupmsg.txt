Setup has determined that you have some networking components that are not compatible with Microsoft Windows XP. If you have a disk containing the files that are necessary to upgrade this component, click Have Disk, and point to those files. If updated files are unavailable, this component may not be upgraded correctly or some settings may be lost.

Setup is sometimes unable to confirm whether a particular network device will upgrade correctly. If you want to discontinue to upgrade at this time, click Cancel to exit Setup.

For a list of devices supported by Windows XP, see the Microsoft Windows XP Hardware Compatibility List at  http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl.
