%NWCLIENT_Desc% needs to be added
%NWCWORKSTATION_Desc% needs to be added

AddParametersKey does stuff for STF_UNATTENDED_SECTION like setting the DefaultLocation 
and DefaultScriptOptions on the Parameters key of the NWCWorkstation service. I've
never seen the NW setup do this, and I don't see where those are defined anyway. Weird.

Can't set permissions on the parameters/option key. Error code 122. Need debug
nwapi32.dll to find the problem.

Make sure that I'm not leaking memory or forgetting to close a reg key!!!

Do I have to add RPC stuff?

Rename Novell.cpl
