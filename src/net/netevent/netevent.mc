MessageId=13555 Severity=Error SymbolicName=EVENT_FRS_IN_ERROR_STATE
Language=English
The File Replication Service is in an error state. Files will not replicate
to or from one or all of the replica sets on his computer until the
following recovery steps are performed:
%n
%n Recovery Steps:
%n
%n [1] The error state may clear itself if you stop and restart the FRS service.
This can be done by performing the following in a command window:
%n
%n    net stop ntfrs
%n    net start ntfrs
%n
%nIf this fails to clear up the problem then proceed as follows.
%n
%n [2] For Active Directory Domain Controllers that DO NOT host any DFS
alternates or other replica sets with replication enabled:
%n
%nIf there is at least one other Domain Controller in this domain then
restore the "system state" of this DC from backup (using ntbackup or other
backup-restore utility) and make it non-authoritative.
%n
%nIf there are NO other Domain Controllers in this domain then restore
the "system state" of this DC from backup (using ntbackup or other
backup-restore utility) and choose the Advanced option which marks
the sysvols as primary.
%n
%nIf there are other Domain Controllers in this domain but ALL of
them have this event log message then restore one of them as primary
(data files from primary will replicate everywhere) and the others as
non-authoritative.
%n
%n
%n [3] For Active Directory Domain Controllers that host DFS alternates
or other replica sets with replication enabled:
%n
%n (3-a) If the Dfs alternates on this DC do not have any other replication
partners then copy the data under that Dfs share to a safe location.
%n (3-b) If this server is the only Active Directory Domain Controller for this
domain then, before going to (3-c),  make sure this server does not have any
inbound or outbound connections to other servers that were formerly Domain
Controllers for this domain but are now off the net (and will never be
coming back online) or have been fresh installed without being demoted.
To delete connections use the Sites and Services snapin and look for
%nSites->NAME_OF_SITE->Servers->NAME_OF_SERVER->NTDS Settings->CONNECTIONS.
%n (3-c) Restore the "system state" of this DC from backup (using ntbackup
or other backup-restore utility) and make it non-authoritative.
%n (3-d) Copy the data from step (3-a) above to the original location
after the sysvol share is published.
%n
%n
%n [4] For other Windows 2000 servers:
%n
%n (4-a)  If any of the DFS alternates or other replica sets hosted by
this server do not have any other replication partners then copy the
data under its share or replica tree root to a safe location.
%n (4-b)  net stop ntfrs
%n (4-c)  rd /s /q  %1
%n (4-d)  net start ntfrs
%n (4-e)  Copy the data from step (4-a) above to the original location after
the service has initialized (5 minutes is a safe waiting time).
%n
%nNote: If this error message is in the eventlog of all the members of a
particular replica set then perform steps (4-a) and (4-e) above on only
one of the members.

MessageId=13556 Severity=Error SymbolicName=EVENT_FRS_REPLICA_NO_ROOT_CHANGE
Language=English
The File Replication Service has detected what appears to be an attempt
to change the root path for the following replica set:
%n    "%1"
%n
%nThis is not allowed.  To perform this operation you must remove this member
from the replica set and add the member back with the new root path.
%n
%nIt is possible that this is a transient error due to Active Directory
replication delays associated with updating FRS configuration objects.  If
file replication does not take place after an appropriate waiting time,
which could be several hours if cross site Active Directory replication
is required, you must delete and re-add this member to the replica set.
%n
%nInformation related to this event is shown below:
%nComputer DNS name is "%2"
%nReplica set member name is "%3"
%nThe current Replica set root path is "%4"
%nThe desired new Replica set root path is "%5"
%nReplica staging directory path is "%6"

%nThis was detected for the following replica set:
%n    "%2"
%n
%nThis is not allowed and replication will not occur between these two
computers until the duplicate connection objects are removed.
%n
%nIt is possible that this is a transient error due to Active Directory
replication delays associated with updating FRS configuration objects.  If
file replication does not take place after an appropriate waiting time,
which could be several hours if cross site Active Directory replication
is required, you must manually delete the duplicate connection objects by
following the steps below:
%n
%n [1] Start the Active Directory Sites and Services Snapin.
%n [2] Click on "%3, %4, %5, %6, %7".
%n [3] Look for duplicate connections from "%1" in site "%8".
%n [4] Delete all but one of the connections.
.

MessageId=13558 Severity=Error SymbolicName=EVENT_FRS_DUPLICATE_IN_CXTION
Language=English
The File Replication Service has detected a duplicate connection object between
this computer "%7" and a computer named "%1".
%nThis was detected for the following replica set:
%n    "%2"
%n
%nThis is not allowed and replication will not occur between these two
computers until the duplicate connection objects are removed.
%n
%nIt is possible that this is a transient error due to Active Directory
replication delays associated with updating FRS configuration objects.  If
file replication does not take place after an appropriate waiting time,
which could be several hours if cross site Active Directory replication
is required, you must manually delete the duplicate connection objects by
following the steps below:
%n
%n [1] Start the Active Directory Users and Computers Snapin.
%n [2] Click the view button and advanced features to display the system node.
%n [3] Click on "%3, %4, %5".
%n [4] Under "%5" you will see one or more DFS related replica set objects.

MessageId=13559 Severity=Error SymbolicName=EVENT_FRS_ROOT_HAS_MOVED
Language=English
The File Replication Service has detected that the replica root path has changed
from "%2" to "%3". If this is an intentional move then a file with the name
NTFRS_CMD_FILE_MOVE_ROOT needs to be created under the new root path.
%nThis was detected for the following replica set:
%n    "%1"
%n
%nChanging the replica root path is a two step process which is triggered by
the creation of the NTFRS_CMD_FILE_MOVE_ROOT file.
%n
%n [1] At the first poll which will occur in %4 minutes this computer will be
deleted from the replica set.
%n [2] At the poll following the deletion this computer will be re-added to the
replica set with the new root path. This re-addition will trigger a full tree
sync for the replica set. At the end of the sync all the files will be at the new
location. The files may or may not be deleted from the old location depending on whether
they are needed or not.
.

MessageId=13560 Severity=Warning SymbolicName=EVENT_FRS_ERROR_REPLICA_SET_DELETED
Language=English
The File Replication Service is deleting this computer from the replica set "%1" as an attempt to
recover from the error state,
%n Error status = %2
%n At the next poll, which will occur in %3 minutes, this computer will be re-added to the
replica set. The re-addition will trigger a full tree sync for the replica set.
.

MessageId=13561 Severity=Error SymbolicName=EVENT_FRS_REPLICA_IN_JRNL_WRAP_ERROR
Language=English
The File Replication Service has detected that the replica set "%1" is in JRNL_WRAP_ERROR.
%n
%n Replica set name is    : "%1"
%n Replica root path is   : "%2"
%n Replica root volume is : "%3"
%n

A Replica set hits JRNL_WRAP_ERROR when the record that it is trying to read from the NTFS USN journal is not found.
This can occur because of one of the following reasons.
%n
%n [1] Volume "%3" has been formatted.
%n [2] The NTFS USN journal on volume "%3" has been deleted.
%n [3] The NTFS USN journal on volume "%3" has been truncated. Chkdsk can truncate
the journal if it finds corrupt entries at the end of the journal.
%n [4] File Replication Service was not running on this computer for a long time.
%n [5] File Replication Service could not keep up with the rate of Disk IO activity on "%3".
%n
%n Following recovery steps will be taken to automatically recover from this error state.
%n [1] At the first poll which will occur in %4 minutes this computer will be
deleted from the replica set.
%n [2] At the poll following the deletion this computer will be re-added to the
replica set. The re-addition will trigger a full tree sync for the replica set.
