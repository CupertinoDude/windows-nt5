When the Protocol's Reconfigure handler is called, the protocol will be in one 
of two condtions - Its binding to the adapter below is open or the binding is 
closed.

if the blinding is closed, then the protocol will call NdisReEnumerate Bindings
and this will restart the Binding  and re-instantiate the miniports.

If the binding is open, then the miniport will walk through the registry and 
Initialize All Device Instances that have been disabled.

I noticed that when the last miniport is disabled, the driver gets unloaded 
causing the protocol to be unbound from the adapter.
