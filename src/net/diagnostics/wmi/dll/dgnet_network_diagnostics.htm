<P>The Network Diagnostics (DGNet) component comprises a Web page, an ActiveX control, and a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider. The ActiveX control and the WMI provider are contained within the same physical dynamic-link library (DLL) called dgnet.dll. The main Web page is named dglogs.htm. The Web page makes calls into the ActiveX control to start and stop, as well as check the progress of the diagnostic tests. The ActiveX control performs a series of operations mostly using WMI. Some WMI calls are made to a Microsoft Win32 provider for general computer information and some are made to the DGNet provider to perform specific tests. The DGNet provider performs PING and TCP connection tests. The PING tests are used to test connectivity to the default gateway, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) servers. TCP connection tests are also used to check the availability of Internet e-mail and newsgroup services.</P>

<P>The Web page resides within the PCHealth framework and can be invoked from a number of places in the user interface (UI) and from the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) hcp:\\system\netdiag\dglogs.htm. The DGNet WMI provider functionality can be invoked separately from the Web page using standard WMI access methods, such as Component Object Model (COM), scripting, or the command line.</P>

<H1 class="dtH1">Component Configuration</H1>

<P>The component is configured by registration with the operating system.</P>
