# This file is used to PRS sign an already built service pack or QFE.
# It can also be used to PRS sign if a previous attempt at PRS signing failed.
#
# Run this with timebuild to PRS sign both catalogs and the final executable.
#
# For example:
#
#    perl tools\timebuild.pl -LANG=usa;ger tools\sp\prs\timebPRSall.txt
#    perl tools\timebuild.pl -LANG=usa;ger -QFE=123456 tools\sp\prs\timebPRSall.txt
#
RESUME QFE
                del /q %_ntpostbld%\build_logs\startprs.txt >nul 2>nul
                LANG           %sdxroot%\Tools\sp\prs\package.cmd <<QFE>>
