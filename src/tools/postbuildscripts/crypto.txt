;
; Column Key
;
; [1] Files involved with crypto signing and/or the high encryption pack encpack.exe creation.
; [2] Path to file after binplacing it, relative to %binaries%.
; [3] Encrypted installers contain an encrypted version of their associated 128-bit binary as
;     a resource; they ship in all languages of the product, but will only install their
;     128-bit binary if the trigger file rsaenhs.dll exists on the machine.  The trigger
;     file gets installed upon running encpack.exe.  There is a one-to-one correspondence
;     between 128-bit files and encrypted installers.
; [4] Attribute of 128-bit file, not the encrypted installer; version-stamp only ==> no
; [5] Crypto MACed (an internal cryptographic checksum requred by FIPS).  maccsp is run on image.
; [6] Crypto signed (not to be confused with PRS/catalog signing).  Yes implies the following:
;     ==> Cryptographic signature added to the image by one of the following methods:
;         a) test signature via US build process public\tools\crypto.cmd (from enigma server)
;         b) real signature via crypto team for final build (from the bbn box in the vault)
;     ==> This files is either a CSP (cryptographic service provider) or security package
;     ==> International languages need to release these files binary-identical to what US releases
;     Change column [11]'s fields to turn on/off test signing on a per-platform basis.  Any
;     file requiring a signature, no matter how it gets signed, needs to have the value 'yes'
;     in this column.
; [7] Terminal services certificate added to image.  Verify with idw\tscrtvfy.exe.
; [8] Applicable product types.
;     srv ==>           bla, sbs, srv, ent, dtc;  installed via tsocenc.inf; they're for terminal services
;     wks ==> wks, per, bla, sbs, srv, ent, dtc;  installed via encinst.inf
;     -   ==> not applicable to any product, perhaps used to generate sfx
; [9] Files that need to be on the encryption pack release share.
;     yes ==> needed for media or test installs
;             the media creation script is orville\razzle -p setup\bom\encpack.bat
;     no  ==> won't hurt to be present, may be useful for testing purposes
;[10] Derived info from other columns to clarify what's needed for international languages.
;     Don't have scripts use this column; use the other columns directly instead.
;     no   <== the file gets crypto signed
;     can  <== the file does not get crypto signed or localized so intl langs have no restrictions
;     yes  <== the file does not get crypto signed AND the file gets localized or is
;              necessarily rebuilt for intl
;[11] This column only applies to files that require signing ([6]==yes).
;     Valid values: any combination of the following: { i386,amd64,ia64 }
;     Test sign binaries on the specified platforms via signcsp.exe and enigma.  Otherwise,
;     these files need to be checked in already vault-signed with real signatures for RTM.
;     Platforms need to be colon-delimited with no spaces.
;     Note that when checking in vault-signed files, the idea is that nothing modifies them
;     afterward.
;       a) avoid rebasing by adding to public\tools\never.reb
;       b) let the perf team know to avoid re-optimizing
;       c) crypto.cmd already marks the file not-to-be-rebound
;       d) these files should not be localized, independent of test or real signing.
