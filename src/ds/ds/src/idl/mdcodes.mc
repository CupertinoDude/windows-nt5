;/*
; * These values are used for logging events to the Windows NT event log,
; * for extended errors, and in some cases for exception values.
; * For a list of values used for exceptions and extended errors see direrr.h .
; * The values in direrr.h used to be defined here, but because they had no
; * strings associated with them, they were moved.  If the value is not used,
; * remove it as described below.
; * If you simply don't use the string associated with a MessageID,
; * but still want to use the ID for logging or exception purposes,
; * remove the value from this file and add it to direrr.h, and then
; * change the prefix from DIRLOG_ to DIRERR_.
; * This will require that you touch all the sources where the values are
; * still used.
; *
; * Logging levels have been assigned to each event in this file. Events
; * marked with a logging level of 0 will always be logged and correspond
; * to the logging level=0 in the diagnostic property page in the
; * Administrator program. When the logging level=1 in the diagnostic
; * property page, events marked as 0 and 1 will be logged, and so
; * on as shown in the table below:
; *
; * When logging level=         These events are logged
; *
; * 0   (no logging)            0
; * 1   (minimal)               0, 1
; * 2   (basic)                 0, 1, 2
; * 3   (extensive)             0, 1, 2, 3
; * 4   (verbose)               0, 1, 2, 3, 4
; * 5   (internal)              0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
; *
; *
; * ADDING AND REMOVING MESSAGES:
; *
; * The messages in this file are auto-numbered, which means that inserting
; * or removing a message from the middle of the file will cause all messages
; * after that point in the file to be renumbered.  As it is often desirable
; * to be able to read an event log with a message file that is from a
; * different build, renumbering existing messages should be avoided.
; *
; * To remove a message, therefore, do NOT simply delete it from the file.
; * Instead change its symbolic name to DIRLOG_UNUSED_xxx (where xxx is a
; * sequential number just used to uniquify the names) and its text to
; * "Unused message".
; *
; * NOTE THAT YOU MUST NOT DELETE OR RE-USE EVENTS THAT WERE MEANINGFUL IN
; * PREVIOUSLY RELEASED VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT.  Why?  Consider an app running
; * on Win2k+1 that scans the event logs of all DCs (Win2k and Win2k+1) in an
; * enterprise.  The scanner should be able to retrieve the text asociated
; * with the Win2k event on the Win2k+1 box (since the event log does not
; * provide this service -- text must always be looked up locally).  Also
; * consider that watchdog tools often cue off of certain event IDs appearing
; * in the event log (e.g., to page an admin when something particularly bad
; * happens), so you don't want event 893 to mean one thing on Win2k and
; * something completely different on Win2k+1.
; *
; * By the same token, YOU MUST NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF INSERTION STRINGS OF
; * EVENTS THAT WERE MEANINGFUL IN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT.
; * It's okay to add new insertion strings to existing event log messages (they
; * just won't be filled in when looking at the event generated by an older
; * DSA), just add them at the end.  (E.g., if %1 %2 and %3 are already used,
; * add new insertion strings at %4, *don't* put the new one as %2 and bump
; * the old %2 to %3 and the old %3 to %4.)  Whether an insertion string is
; * %1 or %4 or whatever of course doesn't restrict where it can be placed in
; * the message text, it only provides a mapping to the order of parameters
; * given to LogEvent.
; *
; * To add a new message, first see if there is an existing unused message
; * that you can recycle.  If so, do so.  If no more unused messages remain,
; * then you must be sure to add new messages only at the very end of the
; * file, which will cause them to get message ids higher than any existing
; * message.

%nThe directory will try to update the object later on the next replication
cycle. Synchronization of this server with the source is effectively blocked
until the update problem is corrected.
%n
%nIf this condition appears to be related to a resource shortage, please
stop and restart this Windows Domain Controller.
%n
%nIf this condition is an internal error, a database error, or an object
relationship or constraint error, manual intervention will be required to
correct the database and allow the update to proceed.  It is valuable to note
that the problem is caused by the fact that the change on the remote system
cannot be applied locally.
Manually updating the objects on the local system is not recommended.
Instead, on the source system (which has the changes already), try to reverse
or back out the change.  Then, on the next replication cycle, observe whether
the change can now be applied locally.

%nThe operation specific arguments are:
%nParameter 1:%5
%nParameter 2:%6
%nParameter 3:%7
%nParameter 4:%8
%n
%nThis data is for information and may be useful in tuning the replication performance of
the system.  Since only one inbound replication may occur at a time, long running
replications delay other replications from coming in in a timely manner.  This system has
been delayed from receiving other directory updates because this replication went on
as long as it did.
%n
%nA long running replication may indicate a large number of updates, or a number of complex updates
(DN-valued attributes) occurring at the source server. Performing these updates during non-
critical times may prevent replication delays during important times.
%n
%nA long running replication is normal in the case of adding a new replica to a system,
either because of installation, Global Catalog promotion, or connection creation by the
KCC.  A long running replication may also occur for a system that has been down,
or a partition that has been out of touch for an extended period.

This server is no longer configured to host the non-domain partition %1.  Its
attempt to transmit its updates and floating single master roles (if any) to
another server failed because no other server that still hosts the partition
could be found on the network.
%n
%nOne or more servers are currently configured to host the partition but no
replica could be located on the network.  Any of the following factors can
result in this symptom:
%n
%n1. The servers currently configured to host this partition are offline.
%n
%n2. The servers currently configured to host this partition have not yet
completed their initial replication of the partition, and thus have not
registered it with the locator.
%n
%n3. The servers currently configured to host this partition have registered
their replica of this partition with the locator, but the servers cannot be
found by the local server due to a network or DNS lookup failure.
%n
%nThis operation will be retried.
