<P>The Security Account Manager (SAM) is responsible for maintaining security principals that can access resources protected by the operating system (OS). Common resources include files and registry keys. SAM allows for properties, like passwords and descriptions, to be set on security principals. SAM also provides information to authentication services so that authentication and authorization can occur. For example, when a user attempts a logon, SAM will provide the password of the user as well as generate the security identifiers (SIDs) that are associated with a user. The authentication provider will use this information to first authenticate the user and then to generate a token containing the SIDs so that subsequent authorization can occur.</P>
