Motorola LDAP Proxy:
-------------------

The Motorola proxy is written using the Network Address Translation (NAT) APIs.
This proxy was custom built for Motorola to convert DC style DNs into X.500
style DNs. The work for this proxy is currently carried out by an MCS consultant
named Phillip Pennington (PhilPen).
