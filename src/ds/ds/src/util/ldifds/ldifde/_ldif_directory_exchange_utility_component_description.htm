<P>This component provides a command-line utility, ldifde.exe, which permits the bulk importing and exporting of directory information to and from a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory, such as Microsoft Active Directory. This utility reads and writes data in the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) file format. It is useful for administrators who need to move large amounts of data from one directory to another. It is also useful for performing bulk operations against the directory, and for distributing schema extensions.</P>

<P>Ldifde.exe does not support the <B>control</B> keyword of the LDIF file format, which is used to specify LDAP version 3 extended controls for operations.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>There are no configuration parameters associated with this component.</P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>The LDIF file format is documented in Request For Comments (RFC) 2849. Documentation for ldifde.exe is available in the Distributed Systems guide of the Server Resource Kit. Additional documentation for using ldifde.exe to extend the schema is available in the Platform SDK and the MSDN Library in the Active Directory section of the Directory Services chapter.</P>
