BFCacheSize_009_Help=Database Cache Size is the amount of system memory used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database file(s) to prevent file operations.  If the database cache size seems to be too small for optimal performance and there is very little available memory on the system (see Memory/Available Bytes), adding more memory to the system may increase performance.  If there is a lot of available memory on the system and the database cache size is not growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit.  Increasing this limit may increase performance.

Veritabanı önbellek boyutu en iyi performans için çok küçükse ve sistemde çok az bellek varsa (bkz. Bellek/Kullanılabilir Baytlar), sisteme bellek eklemek performansı artırabilir.  Sistemdeki kullanılabilir bellek çok fazlaysa ve veritabanı önbellek boyutu belli bir noktadan sonra artmıyorsa, veritabanı önbellek boyutu yapay bir düşük sınırda tutulabilir.  Bu sınırı yükseltmek performansı artırabilir.
BFCacheSize_01D_Help=Cachestorlek för databas är den mängd systemminne som används av databascachehanteraren för att lagra information från databasfilerna som används ofta och på så sätt minska antalet filåtgärder. Om databascachestorleken verkar vara för liten för bästa möjliga prestanda och det finns för lite ledigt minne i systemet (se Minne/Tillgängliga byte), kan prestanda ökas om mer minne läggs till systemet. Om det finns mycket ledigt minne och databascachestorleken är mindre än en viss nivå, kan databascachestorleken vara begränsad till en artificiell låg nivå. Prestanda kanske kan ökas om den här nivån ökas.
BFCacheSize_00A_Help=Tamaño de caché de base de datos es la cantidad de memoria del sistema utilizada por el administrador de caché de base de datos para albergar la información de archivos de base de datos que se utiliza habitualmente, para evitar operaciones de archivos. Si el tamaño de caché de base de datos parece demasiado pequeño para alcanzar un rendimiento óptimo y queda poca memoria disponible en el sistema (véase Memoria/Bytes disponibles), es posible mejorar el rendimiento si se agrega más memoria al sistema. Si hay mucha memoria disponible y el tamaño de la caché de base de datos no crece más allá de un límite determinado, es posible que su tamaño se limite en un punto artificialmente bajo. Si se aumenta este límite podría aumentar el rendimiento.

BFCacheSize_016_Help='Tamanho de cache de base de dados' é a quantidade de memória do sistema utilizada pelo administrador de cache de base de dados para manter informações frequentemente utilizadas pelos ficheiro(s) de base de dados e desse modo impedir operações de ficheiros. Se o tamanho de cache de base de dados parecer ser demasiado pequeno para um desempenho ideal e existir muito pouca memória disponível no sistema (consulte 'Memória/bytes disponíveis'), adicionar mais memória ao sistema poderá melhorar o desempenho. Se existir muita memória disponível no sistema e o tamanho da cache de base de dados não ultrapassar um determinado ponto, este pode estar definido para um valor artificialmente baixo. Aumentar este limite poderá melhorar o desempenho.

BFCacheSize_010_Help=Dimensioni cache database indica la quantità di memoria del sistema utilizzata dal gestore della cache del database per contenere le informazioni comunemente utilizzate da uno o più database per impedire operazioni dei file. Se la cache sembra troppo piccola per assicurare prestazioni ottimali e la memoria disponibile nel sistema è molto limitata (vedere Memoria/byte disponibili), aumentare la memoria del sistema per potenziare le prestazioni. Se la quantità di memoria disponibile è consistente e la cache del database non aumenta oltre un certo punto, è possibile limitarla ad un livello artificiale, il cui incremento può comportare maggiori prestazioni.

BFCacheSize_007_Help=Database Cache Size is the amount of system memory used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database file(s) to prevent file operations.  If the database cache size seems to be too small for optimal performance and there is very little available memory on the system (see Memory/Available Bytes), adding more memory to the system may increase performance.  If there is a lot of available memory on the system and the database cache size is not growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit.  Increasing this limit may increase performance.
BFCacheSize_00C_Help=Taille de cache de base de données correspond à la taille de mémoire système utilisée par le gestionnaire de cache de base de données pour stocker les informations utilisées communément pour empêcher les opérations de fichiers. Si la taille du cache semble trop petite pour des performances optimales et qu'il y a très peu de mémoire disponible sur le système (voir Mémoire/Octets disponibles), l'ajout de mémoire au système peut améliorer les performances. S'il y a beaucoup de mémoire disponible sur le système et que la taille de cache de base de données n'augmente pas au-delà d'un certain point, la taille de cache de base de données peut être délimitée par une valeur arbitrairement basse. Augmenter cette limite peut améliorer les performances.
BFCacheSize_013_Help=De databasecachegrootte is de omvang van het systeemgeheugen dat wordt gebruikt door het databasecachebeheer om de veelgebruikte informatie van databasebestanden te bewaren om bestandsbewerkingen te voorkomen. Als de databasecachegrootte te klein is voor een optimale prestatie en er is onvoldoende systeemgeheugen (zie Geheugen/beschikbare bytes), kan een geheugenuitbreiding van het systeem de prestaties verhogen. Als er meer dan voldoende systeemgeheugen is en de cachegrootte van de database een bepaalde grootte niet overschrijdt, kan de cachegrootte van de database worden beperkt tot een kunstmatige minimumgrens. Het optrekken van de grens verhoogt de prestaties.
