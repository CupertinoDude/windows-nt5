<P>This component contains an Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provider. ADSI provides an interface for the communication with LDAP servers, including Microsoft Exchange 5. <I>x</I> directory and Microsoft Windows 2000 Active Directory. Administrators and developers can enumerate and manage the resources in a directory service by using Component Object Model (COM) interfaces exported by ADSI. These interfaces are compliant with Automation for name-bound controllers like Java, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Visual Basic, Scripting Edition (VBScript). ADSI can also provide an interface that can optimize performance for interfaces that are not compliant with Automation, to use with language environments such as C and C++. </P>

<P>The default ADSI LDAP provider cannot be assumed to be completely thread-safe. Developers of multithreaded applications should take care to properly coordinate any access between threads through the proper use of synchronization objects such as semaphores, mutexes, and critical sections.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>There are no configuration requirements for this component.</P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>Documentation for the ADSI LDAP provider can be found in the Platform SDK and the Directory Services section of the MSDN Library.</P>
