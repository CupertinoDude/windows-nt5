<P>This component is supplied by Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to provide communication with Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 primary domain controllers   and backup domain controllers. Administrators and developers can enumerate and manage the resources in a directory service by using Component Object Model (COM) interfaces exported by ADSI. These interfaces are compliant with Automation for name-bound controllers like Java, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Microsoft Visual Basic, Scripting Edition (VBScript). ADSI can also provide an interface that can optimize performance for interfaces that are not compliant with Automation, to use with language environments like C and C++. </P>

<P>The default ADSI Windows NT provider cannot be assumed to be completely thread-safe. Developers of multithreaded applications should take care to properly coordinate any access between threads through the proper use of synchronization objects such as semaphores, mutexes, and critical sections.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>There are no configuration requirements for this component.</P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>Documentation on Windows NT Provider can be found in the Platform SDK, the Directory Services section of the MSDN Library, and at http://adsi.</P>
