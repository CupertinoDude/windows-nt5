<P>The certificate request client and certificate auto enrollment component allows you to request certificates, find certification authority (CA) on the network, and automatically keep certificates current. </P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>You must use auto enrollment on a domain that is directed through settings in the Microsoft Active Directory™ directory service. You can modify these settings through the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in tool, called Certificate Templates. No additional configuration is required if the certificate request client application programming interfaces (APIs) are used.</P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>For more information about certificates and their use in security services, see this <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.asp">Microsoft Web site</A>. Choose <B>Windows 2000 Home Page</B> and then search for security services.</P>
