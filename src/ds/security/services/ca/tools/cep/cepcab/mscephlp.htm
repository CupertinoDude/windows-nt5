<H2>Installing Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) Add-on for Certificate Services and Enrolling for Certificates from a Cisco Router</H2>


<P>The Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) Add-on for Certificate Services runs on Windows&nbsp;2000 Server.</P>

<P>This tool is not installed by the <I>Windows&nbsp;2000 Resource Kit</I> Setup. To install it, use the following procedure:</P>

<H3>Before you start</H3>
<UL>
<LI><P>You must install the SCEP Add-on for Certificate Services for on a root certification authority (CA). Both enterprise root CAs and stand-alone root CAs are supported. You can install the SCEP Add-on for Certificate Services on a subordinate CA. However, as of October 1999, existing versions of Cisco routers will not be able to request certificates from the subordinate CA.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The CA should be in a separate certification hierarchy from all other CAs in your organization.</P></LI>

<LI><P>You need to have proper administrative privileges to install the SCEP Add-on for Certificate Services.  By default, you need to be a member of the Enterprise Administrators group or the root Domain Administrators group to install this add-on on an enterprise CA, or you need to be a member of the computer administrators group to install this add-on on a standalone CA</P></LI>

<LI><P>The SCEP Add-on for Certificate Services cannot be installed on a Windows&nbsp;2000 CA that has any non-alphanumeric characters (&amp;,*, :, ;, ', &quot;, etc.) in its name.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>To install SCEP Add-on for Certificate Services on a Windows&nbsp;2000 root CA</H3>

<OL>
<LI><P>Log on with the appropriate administrative privileges to the server on which the root CA is installed.</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Click <B>Start</B>, click <B>Run</B>, then type <I>drive</I><B>:cepsetup.exe</B> where <I>drive</I> is the CD-ROM drive where the Windows&nbsp;2000 Resource Kit CD is located or the disk drive where you have downloaded cepsetup.exe.</P></LI>
<LI><P>In the SCEP Add-on for Certificate Services Setup wizard:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Select whether or not you want to require a challenge phrase for router certificate enrollment.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Enter information about who is enrolling for the Registration Authority (RA) certificate, which will later allow certificates to be requested from the CA on behalf of the router.</P></LI>
<LI><P>(Optional) Select Advanced Enrollment Options if you want to specify the cryptographic service provider (CSP) and key lengths for the RA signature and encryption keys.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The URL - <B>http://<I>URLHostName</I>/certsrv/mscep/mscep.dll</B> - is displayed when the SCEP Setup wizard finishes and confirms a successful installation. <I>URLHostName</I> is the name of the server which hosts the CA's enrollment Web pages (also referred to as Certificate Services Web pages).</P>

<LI><P>You are asked to input a password.</P>

<P>Using Internet Explorer, retrieve a valid challenge password by connecting to the URL: <B>http://<I>URLHostName</I>/certsrv/mscep/mscep.dll</B>.</P>

<P>Some notes about this password:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Every time you connect to this URL, a different challenge password is displayed.  Each challenge password is valid for 60 minutes and can only be used once.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The password displayed is both the challenge password for certificate enrollment and the password for certificate revocation. Remember this password so that in case you need to revoke the certificate, you can provide it to the CA administrator.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If you connect to the URL above and do not see a challenge password displayed, then the SCEP Add-on was not setup to require a challenge password.  In this case, you can make up a password of your own choosing.  This password will be used for certificate revocation only.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If you are requesting a certificate from an enterprise CA, you must have the right to enroll for certificates based on the <B>IPSecIntermediateOffline</B> certificate template in order to access the URL above. By default, a member of the Enterprise Administrators group or the root Domain Administrators group will have the right to enroll for certificates based on the <B>IPSecIntermediateOffline</B> certificate template.</P>

<P>See the procedure entitled <B>Set security permissions and delegate control of certificate templates</B> in Windows 2000 Server online help for the procedure to change enrollment permissions for certificate templates.</P></LI>
