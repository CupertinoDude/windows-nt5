How to build xenrlinf.cab:

1) Make your changes to xenroll.inf and check it in so we'll have it.
   The only reason I know of to change this file is when the list of
   platforms we support changes.

2) Use cabarc.exe to put the xenroll.inf in a cab. You need to leave
   some space for the signature. I have no idea how much is really
   necessary, but the cabarc help mentions 6K. If you determine a
   better size, please update this file. I have checked in cabarc.exe
   because it's not a standard tool, but you should be able to get
   this from a variety of places (ie, the Cabinet SDK).

	cabarc -s 6144 n xenrlinf.cab xenroll.inf

3) Get the cab signed the same way a dll gets signed. I have included
   the list.txt file I used. If you change it, update it here and
   check it in too. See http://prslab/codesign for more info.

4) Check the new signed cab into nt\ds\security\services\ca\certweb.
   The cab will be grabbed from this directory during the build
   (along with the rest of the web pages).
