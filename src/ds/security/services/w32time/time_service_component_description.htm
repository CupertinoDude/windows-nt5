<P>The Time Service component synchronizes a workstation's clock with other computers using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 3.  For increased accuracy, the Time Service component also incorporates algorithmic enhancements from NTP 4.</P>

<P>In a Windows2000 or XP domain, the Time Service component will automatically synchronize the time with a domain controller. The network time samples are authenticated using the NetLogon secure channel. If your time source becomes unavailable, the Time Service component will dynamically discover a new source of time.</P>

<P>The Time Service component allows you to synchronize your clock from a variety of hardware clocks using extensible, plug-in provider architecture. This allows you to keep accurate time using a variety of clocks, including Global Positional System (GPS) clocks and cesium clocks.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>The Time Service component is configured using the command-line tool w32tm.exe. This executable allows you to specify a time source, monitor other NTP servers, resynchronize your computer clock, and propagate registry changes to the Time Service component. If your computer is connected to a network domain, the component does not to be configured. You can use the w32tm tool to override the default settings or if your computer is not connected to a domain.</P>
