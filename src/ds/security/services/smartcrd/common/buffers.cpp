CBuffer:

    This constructor is a special case for use explicitly with the operator+
    routine.  It builds a CBuffer out of the other two with only a single
    allocation.

Arguments:

    bfSourceOne supplies the first part of the new buffer
    bfSourceTwo supplies the second part of the new buffer.

Return Value:

    None

Clear:

    This routine resets a CBuffer to it's initial state, freeing any allocated
    memory.

Arguments:

    None

Return Value:

    None

Reset:

    This routine logically empties the CBuffer without actually deallocating
    memory.  It's data lengh goes to zero.

Arguments:

    None

Return Value:

    The address of the buffer.

/*++

Presize:

    This is the primary workhorse of the CBuffer class.  It ensures that the
    size of the buffer is of the proper size.  Data in the buffer may optionally
    be preserved, in which case the data length doesn't change.  If the buffer
    is not preserved, then the data length is reset to zero.

Arguments:

    cbLength supplies the desired length of the buffer.

    fPreserve supplies a flag indicating whether or not to preserve the current
        contents of the buffer.

Return Value:

    The address of the properly sized buffer.

Resize:

    This method sets the length of the data to the given size.  If the buffer

Arguments:

    cbLength supplies the new length of the data.

    fPreserve supplies a flag indicating whether or not to preserve existing
        data.

Return Value:

    The address of the buffer.

operator+:

    This routine is a special operator that allows addition of two CBuffers to
    produce a third, a la bfThree = bfOne + bfTwo.  It calls the special
    protected constructor of CBuffer.

Arguments:

    bfSourceOne supplies the first buffer
    bfSourceTwo supplies the second buffer

Return Value:

    A reference to a temporary CBuffer that is the concatenation of the two
    provided buffers.
