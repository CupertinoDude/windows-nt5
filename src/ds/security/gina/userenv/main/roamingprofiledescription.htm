<P>A roaming user profile is a type of profile that is stored centrally on a server. This profile is available every time a user logs on to any computer on the network and any changes made to a roaming user profile are updated on the server.</P>

<P>A roaming profile is created the first time a user logs on to a computer, in the same way as a local user profile. When the user logs off, the local profile is copied to the location specified in the profile path on the user object. If a profile already exists on the server, the local profile is merged with the server copy. For subsequent logons, the contents of the local cached profile are compared with the copy of the profile on the server, and the two profiles are merged.</P>

<P>Roaming user profiles are merged at the file level. The merged profile contains the superset of files that are in the local computer and server copies of the user’s profile. In the case where the same file is in both the local and server copy of the profile, the file that was modified most recently is used. This implies that new files are not deleted, and updated versions of existing files are not overwritten.</P>

<P>There are no configuration requirements associated with this component. </P>
