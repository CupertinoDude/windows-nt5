<P>A user profile is a group of settings and files that defines the environment that the system loads when a user logs on. It includes all the user-specific configuration settings, such as program items, screen colors, network connections, printer connections, mouse settings, and window size and position. </P>

<P>A user profile consists of a registry hive and a set of folders stored in the file system. The user profile registry hive is ntuser.dat in file form, and is mapped to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER portion of the registry when the user logs on. The series of profile directories store application data, temporary files, shortcut links, desktop icons, and other application-related data. </P>

<P>A local user profile is created the first time a user logs on to a computer, and is stored on the local drive. Any changes made to the local user profile are specific to the computer on which the changes are made.</P>
