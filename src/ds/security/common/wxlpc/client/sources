#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM).  UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.
#

TARGETPATH=$(DS_GLOBAL_LIB_DEST)
TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

INCLUDES=..\inc;$(DS_INC_PATH)\crypto;
