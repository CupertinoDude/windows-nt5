#
# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.
#

MAJORCOMP=SECURITY
MINORCOMP=msv1_0

#
# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=ntlmkrnl

#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM).  UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.
#

TARGETPATH=$(SECURITY_LIB_DEST)

# Pick one of the following and delete the others
TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

INCLUDES=.;..;..\..\inc;

INCLUDES=.;..;\
         $(SECURITY_INC);\
         $(DS_INC_PATH);$(DS_INC_PATH)\crypto;\

# Use this to flag Uninitialized variables
# COMPILER_WARNINGS=$(COMPILER_WARNINGS) -FI$(SECURITY_INC)\secwarn.h

#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
#

SOURCES=krnlapi.cxx \
        ..\crc32.c

# Next specify options for the compiler.
