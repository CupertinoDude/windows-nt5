Here is a brief description about how to sign xenroll.dll,

1. backup xenroll.dll and xenroll.pdb from VBL release to a local directory (since signing process may take days and VBL release may be removed any time so backup all files for your checkin is a good idea)

2. use a virus checking tool to run on dlls and symbol files (I use Cheyenne Innoculan), see http://prslab

3. test signing dll as follows,
    3.1.create a list.txt file contains one line (for xenroll)
 xenroll.dll,Microsoft Certificate Enrollment Control,http://www.microsoft.com
    3.2.create a directory on your local machine. 
    3.3.copy all the files from "\\prslab\tools\IE4Tools" to the directory
    3.4.copy unsigned xenroll.dll and the LIST.TXT file to the directory as well
    3.5.run SIGNFILES.BAT 
    3.6.give the same password during the signing test
    3.7.make sure signing test succeeded

4. create a signing request at http://prslab/codesign/tool.htm. You need two co-signers to sign up the request. It seems prs web auto email doesn't work sometimes so you should consider to send a mail including the request # by yourself to notify the co-signers.

5. wait for an email from prslab about signing. again you should consider to check the request web site once a day because prslab auto mail doesn't work well.

6. once the signing is done, go to http://prslab/codesign/tool.htm to down load signed DLLs to a local directory

7. copy xenroll.pdb from your backup to the directory that signed DLLs reside

8. from the local directory, run ntsd regsvr32 .\xenroll.dll

9. sxeld (in ntsd)

10. g (repeat in ntsd until you see xenroll.dll is loaded from the current directory) 

11. x xenroll!* to see if you can load symbols

12. sd edit both xenroll.dll and xenroll.pdb from ..\ds\security\cryptoapi\pki\activex\release\xenroll\%platform%

13. copy signed xenroll.dll and corresponding xenroll.pdb to the above path and overwrite both files

14. sd submit both xenroll.dll and xenroll.pdb
