# The README File for the PERFMON hook up code to the NTFRS.

To add/delete a counter to either REPLICASET or REPLICACONN Object you
need to do the following :

1. Add/Delete it to/from the counter definition structure (ReplicaSetCounters or
   ReplicaConnCounters) in the perrepsr.h file in the ntrepl/inc directory.
   
2. Add/Delete (in the format specified) the new/old counter line to/from the 
   NTFRSREP.INT or/and NTFRSCON.int files. The format is,
   StructName : STFieldName : CounterName : CounterType : HelpString

3. Build the generated files using genfiles.cmd

   *NOTE* Since perl is not supported in the build (licensing issues with tool distribution)
   The developer must regenerate the result files and check them in to the SLM tree.
   The genfiles.cmd script above does this by checking the generated files out and then runs
   nmake to generate new files.  This is not run automatically as part of the build.

4. Add code to the service that sets or increments the counter value added to the
   ReplicaSetCounters or ReplicaConnCounters struct above.  Use one of the following
   macros (or define a new one if necc.) PM_INC_CTR_REPSET, PM_INC_CTR_CXTION, 
   PM_SET_CTR_REPSET, PM_SET_CTR_CXTION, PM_INC_CTR_SERVICE, PM_SET_CTR_SERVICE.

5. Check both the *.int file(s) and the generated files from step 3 back into the slm tree.

6. Rebuild service.
