Abstract:

    Domain Name System (DNS) Server

    Sources file for binplacing DNS samples file.

    Note, the real action here is in makefile.inc which specifies the
    binplacing of the sample files.  Its execution is caused by the
    sample.bin target below.  Note, that the dummy C-file exists only
    because build requires an actual target in the sources file.
