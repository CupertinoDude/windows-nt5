;
;   DNS boot file
;
;   NOTE:   It is NOT necessary to use a boot file to run the DNS server.
;
;   The Microsoft DNS server is capable of reading configuration, zone
;   and cache information from a "boot" file or from the registry.
;
;   To take full advantage of the capabilities of the Microsoft DNS
;   server we suggest using the DNS Administration tool (dnsadmin.exe).
;   If you are new to DNS or are setting up a new installation, then we
;   strongly recommend using the Admin tool, in which case you need not
;   setup a boot file.
;
;   However, if you are porting an existing BIND DNS installation, then
;   the DNS server will be able to read your existing boot file.  Note,
;   that the file MUST be named "boot".
;

;
;   Boot file syntax:
;
;   Directives in this file instruct the DNS service when it is starting.
;   Anything on a line followin a semicolon ';' is a comment, and is ignored.
;
;   This file and all files listed in this file must be in
;   %SystemRoot%\system32\dns directory.
;

;
;   CACHE FILE
;
;   The "cache" file is not really cache information.  Rather it contains
;   name server and IP address information necessary to contact the ROOT
;   domain name servers.
;
;   The syntax of this command is:
;
;       cache   .       <filename>
;
;   YOU SHOULD CHANGE:
;
;   =>  Nothing - do NOT change this line, if you are NOT a root domain
;       server.
;       (Note:  if you are not connected to the Internet, be sure and edit
;       the cache file to point at the root servers for your intranet.)
;
;       OR
;
;   =>  Comment out this line, if this DNS server is the ROOT domain
;       server for a private intranet.
;

cache   .   cache.dns


;
;   PRIMARY DOMAINS
;
;   "Primary" domains are listed below.  The second column is the name of the
;   domain for which this name server is authoritative.  The third column is
;   the name if the database file which contains the authoritative data.
;
;   The syntax of this command is:
;
;       primary <domain> <filename>
;
;   YOU SHOULD CHANGE:
;       - The names of the domains.
;       - The names of the database files.
;       - Comment out domains for which server will be secondary.
;

;primary   place.dom                 place.dns
;primary   29.5.192.in-addr.arpa     192.dns



;
;   SECONDARY DOMAINS
;
;   "Secondary" domains are listed below.
;
;   The syntax of this command is:
;
;       secondary <domain> <master DNS ip address> <filename>
;
;   YOU SHOULD CHANGE:
;       - The names of the domains.
;       - The names of the database files.
;       - The IP address of the primary DNS server (192.255.255.7).
;       - Uncomment domains for which server will be secondary, then
;         comment out the primary statement for that domain above.
;

;secondary   place.dom                  192.5.29.7   place.dns
;secondary   29.5.192.in-addr.arpa      192.5.29.7   192.dns
