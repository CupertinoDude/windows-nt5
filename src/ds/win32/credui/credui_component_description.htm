<P>The Credentials Management User Interface (UI) component allows Microsoft Windows XP application developers to prompt users for credential information. Examples of credential information include data identifying the useridentifying data, such as a user name, and confidential data, such as a password.</P>

<P>Applications can use the Credentials Management application programming interface (API) to request account information be used in place of the credentials established at logon. Typically, this is useful when the user's logon credentials do not have privileges or permissions required by the application. As with a standard logon, the user's password is never made available to the application. </P>

<P>Applications that perform user validation requiring information other than logon credentials can use the Credentials Management UI API to gather this information. The Credentials Management UI provides these applications with an interface that has a look and feel consistent with Windows XP. </P>

<H1>Configuring the Component</H1>

<P>The component requires no configuration.</P>

<H1>For More Information</H1>

<P>Additional information about this component, including sample code, can be found in the Platform SDK and Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN).</P>
