associated media, printed materials, "online" or electronic
documentation, and Internet-based services ("Product").    An
amendment or addendum to this EULA may accompany the Product. 
YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
EULA BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE
USING THE PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO
NOT INSTALL OR USE THE PRODUCT.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you the following rights
  provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of
  this EULA:

* Installation and use.  Microsoft may provide the Product
accompanying this EULA as a web-based download or on a CD-ROM. 
Microsoft grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, 
nontransferable, royalty-free license to install and use one 
(1) copy of the executable code of the Product on a single 
computer residing on your premises ("Workstation Computer"), 
solely to test the product internally, test the compatibility 
of your application or other product(s) which operate in 
conjunction with the Product, and to evaluate the Product for 
the purpose of providing feedback thereon to Microsoft.  The 
foregoing limit is aggregate and applies regardless of how 
many copies of the Product you obtain from Microsoft.  If you 
are downloading the product from a Microsoft web site, you may 
make one (1) additional copy of the Product onto a CD-ROM to 
exercise the rights granted above.  All other rights are 
reserved to Microsoft.  You shall not rent, lease, sell, 
sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer any portion of the 
Product. You may not use the Product in a live operating 
environment where it may be relied upon to perform in the same 
manner as a commercially released product or with data that 
has not been sufficiently backed up.  You may not use the 
Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft and 
its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership rights to 
the Product, and this EULA shall not be construed in any 
manner as transferring any rights of ownership or license to 
the Product or to the features or information therein, except 
as specifically stated herein. 

* You agree to provide to Microsoft reasonable suggestions,
comments and feedback regarding the Product, including but not
limited to usability, bug reports and test results, with
respect to Product testing (collectively, "Feedback").  You
grant Microsoft, under all of your intellectual property and
proprietary rights, the following worldwide, non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, fully paid up rights:
(1) to make, use, copy, modify, and create derivative works
of, the Feedback as part of any Microsoft product, technology,
service, specification or other documentation (collectively, 
"Microsoft Offerings"), (2) to publicly perform or display, 
import, broadcast, transmit, distribute, license, offer to 
sell, and sell, rent, lease or lend copies of the Feedback 
(and derivative works thereof) as part of any Microsoft 
Offering, (3) solely with respect to your copyright and trade 
secret rights, to sublicense to third parties the foregoing 
rights, including the right to sublicense to further third 
parties, and (4) to sublicense to third parties any claims of 
any patents owned or licensable by you that are necessarily 
infringed by a third party product, technology or service that 
uses, interfaces, interoperates or communicates with the 
Feedback or portion thereof incorporated into a Microsoft 
product, technology or service. Further, you warrant that your 
Feedback is not subject to license terms that will require, or 
claim to require, that any Microsoft Offering that 
incorporates any Feedback  (or any intellectual property
therein) be licensed to any third party on specified terms. 
Due to the nature of the development work, Microsoft provides
no assurance that any specific errors or discrepancies in the
Product will be corrected.

* In the event Microsoft, in its sole discretion, elects to
provide deliveries of Product to more than one individual
employed by you (if you are not a single individual), each
such recipient shall be entitled to exercise the rights
granted in this EULA, and shall be bound by the terms and
conditions herein.

EULA are limited to the first fourteen (14) days after you

Product that are designed to prevent unlicensed or illegal use
of the Product.  You agree that we may use those measures.

HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) DAYS.  THE PRODUCT IS
TIME SENSITIVE AND WILL NOT FUNCTION UPON

expressly granted to you in this EULA.

  commercially available.  

4. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES.  This EULA
  applies to updates, supplements, add-on components,
  or Internet-based services components, of the Product that
  Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you
  after the date you obtain your initial copy of the
  Product, unless we provide other terms along with the
  update, supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based
  services component.  Microsoft reserves the right to
  discontinue any Internet-based services provided to you or
  made available to you through the use of the Product. 
  This EULA does not grant you any rights to use the Windows

  components contained in the Product to develop a software
  application that uses Windows Media technology.  If you
  wish to use the WMFSDK to develop such an application,

  Microsoft may cancel this EULA if you do not abide by the

  parts.

7. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND
  LIMITATIONS.  

* NetMeeting/Remote Assistance/Remote Desktop Features.  The
Product contains NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote
Desktop technologies that enable the Product or other
applications installed on the Workstation Computer to be used
remotely between two or more computers, even if the Product or
application is installed on only one Workstation Computer. 
You may use NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote Desktop
with all Microsoft products; provided however, use of these
technologies with certain Microsoft products may require an
additional license.  For Microsoft and non-Microsoft products,
you should consult the license agreement accompanying the
applicable product or contact the applicable licensor to
determine whether use of NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, or
Remote Desktop is permitted without an additional license.

* Consent to Use of Data.  You agree that Microsoft and its
affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered
in any manner as part of the product support services provided
to you, if any, related to the Product.  Microsoft may use

customized services or technologies to you.  Microsoft may
disclose this information to others, but not in a form that
personally identifies you.   

* Internet Gaming/Update Features.  If you choose to utilize
the Internet gaming or update features within the Product, it
is necessary to use certain computer system, hardware, and
software information to implement the features.   By using
these features, you explicitly authorize Microsoft or its
designated agent to access and utilize the necessary
information for Internet gaming and/or updating purposes.  
Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our

provide upgrades or fixes to the Product that will be
automatically downloaded to your Workstation Computer.  

* Security Updates.  Content providers are using the digital
rights management technology ("Microsoft DRM") contained in
this Product to protect the integrity of their content (
"Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. 
Owners of such Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may,
from time to time, request Microsoft to provide security
related updates to the Microsoft DRM components of the Product
("Security Updates") that may affect your ability to copy,
display and/or play Secure Content through Microsoft software
or third party applications that utilize Microsoft DRM.  You
therefore agree that, if you elect to download a license from
the Internet which enables your use of Secure Content,
Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download
onto your computer such Security Updates that a Secure Content
Owner has requested that Microsoft distribute.  Microsoft will
not retrieve any personally identifiable information, or any
other information, from your computer by downloading such
Security Updates.
