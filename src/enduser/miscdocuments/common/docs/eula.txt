180 DAY LICENSE

This is a legal agreement ("Agreement") between you (either an
individual or an entity), the end user ("Recipient"), and
Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft").  BY INSTALLING, COPYING OR
OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCT (AS DEFINED
BELOW), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY
OR USE THE PRODUCT.

MICROSOFT LICENSE AND NON-DISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT FOR PRE-RELEASE CODE for the
Microsoft Product code-named "Whistler" 

 1. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR DUAL DISTRIBUTION. 

    (a) Microsoft may provide the software accompanying this
    Agreement (the "Product") as a web-based download or on a
    CD-ROM.  Microsoft grants Recipient a limited, non
    -exclusive, nontransferable, non-assignable, royalty-free
    license to install and use copies of the Product on up to
    one (1) computers residing on Recipient's premises,
    solely for Recipient's internal testing.  The foregoing
    limit is aggregate and applies regardless of how many
    copies of the Product Recipient obtains from Microsoft. 
    If Recipient is downloading the Product from a Microsoft
    web site, Recipient may make one (1) additional copy of
    the Product onto a CD-ROM to exercise the rights granted
    above.  All other rights are reserved to Microsoft. 
    Recipient shall not rent, lease, sell, sublicense,
    assign, or otherwise transfer the Product or any
    accompanying printed materials ("Documentation"). 
    Recipient may not reverse engineer or decompile the
    Product, except to the extent that local law expressly
    prohibits the foregoing restriction.  Recipient may not
    use the Product in a live operating environment where it
    may be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a
    commercially released product or with data that has not
    been sufficiently backed up.  Recipient may not use the
    Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft
    and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership
    rights to the Product, and this Agreement shall not be
    construed in any manner as transferring any rights of
    ownership or license to the Product or to the features or
    information therein, except as specifically stated
    herein.

    (b) Mandatory Activation. The license rights granted under
    this EULA may be limited to the first fourteen (14) days
    after Recipient first boots the Software Product unless
    Recipient activates Recipient's copy of the Software
    Product in the manner described during the setup sequence
    of the Software Product and, as a result of such
    activation, Recipient receives a final confirmation
    number for the Software Product.  Any use of the Software
    Product after the fourteenth (14th) day will require
    Recipient's input of such confirmation number.  

    (c) RECIPIENT'S RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT
    SHALL BE EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE
    RECIPIENT FIRST INSTALLS ANY PORTION
    OF THE PRODUCT ON ANY DEVICE FOR A
    PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180)
    DAYS. THE PRODUCT IS TIME SENSITIVE
    AND WILL NOT FUNCTION UPON EXPIRATION
    OF THE 180 DAY PERIOD. NOTICE OF
    EXPIRATION WILL NOT ACTIVELY BE
    GIVEN, SO RECIPIENT NEEDS TO PLAN FOR
    THE EXPIRATION DATE AND MAKE A COPY
    OF AND REMOVE RECIPIENT'S IMPORTANT
    DATA BEFORE EXPIRATION. If Recipient
    desires to use the Product after evaluation is completed,
    Recipient will need to acquire a validly licensed copy of
    the non-evaluation version of the Product.

    (d) At Microsoft's request, Recipient agrees to provide
    reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not
    limited to usability, bug reports and test results, with
    respect to the testing of the Product.  In addition, if
    requested by Microsoft, Recipient will use reasonable
    efforts to review and comment on all documentation
    supplied.  All bug reports, test results and other
    feedback made by Recipient shall be the property of
    Microsoft and may be used by Microsoft for any purpose it
    sees fit.  Due to the nature of the development work,
    Microsoft is not certain if errors or discrepancies in
    the Product may be corrected.

    (e) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
    Recipient's site. Recipient may not demonstrate or show
    the Product to third parties without the express written
    permission of Microsoft.

    (f) Recipient's use of software applications installed on or
    accessed through the Product's IntelliMirror, Terminal
    Services, or application-sharing functionality may
    require additional licenses - please consult the license
    agreement accompanying such software.

 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT.  The term of this Agreement shall commence
    upon Recipient's copying, installing or using the Product
    and shall continue unless terminated by Microsoft in
    writing at any time, with or without cause.  This
    Agreement will terminate without notice upon the
    commercial release of the Product.  Upon the termination
    of this Agreement, Recipient shall cease use of the
    Product and, upon request, shall promptly return to
    Microsoft, or certify destruction of, all full or partial
    copies of the Product and related materials provided by
    Microsoft.

 3. SUPPORT.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide technical or
    other support for the Product.  However, limited
    technical support ("Support Services"), if noted in the
    materials provided to Recipient by Microsoft, may be
    available. Use of any such Support Services is governed
    by the Microsoft policies and programs described in
    "online" documentation, and/or in other Microsoft-provided
    materials.  Any supplemental software code provided to
    Recipient as part of the Support Services shall be
    considered part of the Product and subject to the terms
    and conditions of this Agreement. With respect to
    technical information Recipient provides to Microsoft as
    part of the Support Services, Microsoft may use such
    information for its business purposes, including for
    product support and development. Microsoft will not
    utilize such technical information in a form that
    personally identifies Recipient.  Such limited Support
    Services may not be available in all countries outside
    the United States and will be discontinued once the
    Product is commercially released.

 4. MAINTENANCE.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide
    maintenance, technical support, or updates to Recipient
    for Product licensed under this Agreement.  In no event
    shall Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient, free
    of charge, a copy of the commercial release version of
    the Product in connection with Recipient's participation
    in the testing program.  Microsoft is not obligated to
    make the Product commercially available.  

 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  To the maximum
    extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and its
    suppliers provide to Recipient the Product and Support
    Services AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS;
    and Microsoft and its suppliers hereby disclaim with
    respect to the Product and Support Services all
    warranties and conditions, whether express, implied or

    SUPPORT SERVICES REMAINS WITH
    RECIPIENT.

    AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO THE
    MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE

    OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT
    SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN
    CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS
    AGREEMENT, EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR ANY
    SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.   

 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. 
    Notwithstanding any damages that Recipient might incur
    for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation,

    damages), the entire liability of Microsoft and any of
    its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and

    reasonable reliance up to the greater of the amount
    actually paid by Recipient for the Product or U.S.$5.00.

    King County, Washington, unless no federal subject matter
    jurisdiction exists, in which case Recipient consents to

    authorized by applicable law or court rule.  If either
