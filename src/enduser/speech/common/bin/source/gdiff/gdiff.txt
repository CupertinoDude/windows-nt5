   GDIFF  -  A graphical diff viewer
-----------------------------------------

SCOMP:
   If you're running Chicago or a VxD which allows you to run Windows apps
   from a DOS box, use GD.BAT to view an scomp.  Typing
      GD.BAT
   will show the scomp of all files in the directory.  Typing
      GD.BAT file1 file2
   will show only the changes in file1 and file2.

   If you're not running Chicago, type the following command from DOS:
      scomp -b > foo.dif
   From GDiff, choose File.ReadScomp and select the file, foo.dif.

DIFF:
   You can also view the differences of files that are not slm'd.
   Simply use GDC.BAT.  (If you're not running Chicago, you can modify
   the batch file to your taste.)

FILES:
   You can also open and view other files for convenience.
   Just use File.Open.

COMMAND LINE:
   If you specify an Scomp file on the command line, GDiff will automatically
   load it when starting.

PRINTING:
   Printing is beta level but should generally work.  The printer font
   is set under the Options menu and is independent of the screen
   font.  If there are few changes to a file, you will probably want to set
   the "Only Print Pages w/Changes" option in the Option menu.

CONTROLS:
   Funky Left Mouse Button (optional): page up or down depending
                                       on vertical position
   Right Mouse Button: moves the center bar for visibility
   Cursor Keys: obvious
   Function Keys: see below

PROBLEMS:
   (including suggestions, bugs, pure aesthetic disgraces, etc.)
   Please report to Raymond E. Endres [rayen].
