July 22, 1996 Release (IPFCS1RC3)
=================================
o moved cst_lbc.h into acm archive

o modified g723.c so that SID modes are disabled.  This way broken
  applications (e.g., SoundRecorder) aren't affected.

July 18, 1996 Beta Release
==========================

o Added 11025 Hz PCM format capabilities.

o Integrated Mike Keith's 8000-to-11000 Hz and 11000-to-8000 Hz
  sample rate conversion routines.

o Added code to acmdStreamConvert() (in g723.c ) to fudge from
  11000 Hz to 11025 Hz sampling rate and vice versa.

o Made 11025 Hz the default format since it is the more widely
  supported by PC hardware and since this prevents certain
  applications from using low quality sample rate converters and
  introducing unnecessary distortion (see CAVEATS below).

o Made changes in acmdStreamConvert() so that speech and silence
  frames can both be encoded from the same driver buffer.  This
  ensures that applications using large driver buffer sizes will
  still benefit from silence detection.

o Corrected the name of the speech coding algorithm in g723.rc.
  The name of the algorithm is "G.723.1" and not "G.723".

o Microsoft's "Sound Recorder" application that comes with Win95
  has some problems that are exposed by the G.723.1 ACM driver.
  Sound Recorder always uses the default ACM driver format.
  Therefore, when asked to encode 8 KHz PCM using G.723.1,
  it first upsamples the data to 11025 KHz using a low quality
  sample rate converter (thereby introducing unnecessary distortion).

o Microsoft's "Sound Recorder" and "ACMAPP" applications both
  apparently ignore the cbSrcLengthUsed field of the
  LPACMDRVSTREAMHEADER structure.  Consequently, the unused portion
  of a buffer of G.723.1 data is discarded instead of being moved to
  the start of the next driver buffer.  The result is that subsequent
  frames of G.723.1 data are misaligned and are not properly decoded.

  ANY APPLICATION THAT IGNORES THE cbSrcLengthUsed FIELD IN THIS WAY
  WILL FAIL RESULTING IN GARBLED AUDIO!!!

o As a result of the above problem the G.723.1 formats that use
  silence detection have not been fully tested in this release.
