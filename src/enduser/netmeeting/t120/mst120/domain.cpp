 *
 *	Abstract:
 *		This is the implementation file for the domain class.  The domain
 *		class encapsulates a single instance of a domain information base.
 *		This class include all code necessary to modify and act upon that
 *		information base.  Almost all activity into and out of objects of
 *		this class is in the form of MCS commands.  These commands are
 *		implemented as virtual member functions that are inherited from its
 *		base class CommandTarget.  These commands are essentially the same
 *		as the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) defined in T.125.
 *
 *		This class inherits from CommandTarget, which is where the virtual
 *		member functions for each command is defined.  All commands that are
 *		handled by this class are overridden by it.  Life for a domain object
 *		consists of receiving these commands and responding by transmitting
 *		these commands.  A Domain object has no need for its own "thread" of
 *		execution.
 *
 *		Instances of the domain class maintain an information base that is
 *		used to determine how to respond to these commands.  The commands are
 *		not only routed according to the state of the information base, but also
 *		act to change the information base.  When two MCS providers are
 *		connected, the domain objects within them become logically linked.  This
 *		means that they exchange these commands in such a manner as to guarantee
 *		the MCS services for which the providers are responsible.
 *
 *		When a domain object is first instantiated, its information base is
 *		empty.  That is, it has no user attachments, no MCS connections, no
 *		channels, no tokens, and no queued requests.  As the domain object
 *		processes commands, the information base takes shape, and all subsequent
 *		activity follows that shape.
 *
 *		By necessity, there is a lot of complex code in this module.  This is to
 *		allow for all the timing problems that can occur in a distributed
 *		network, such as MCS provides for.  In order to reduce the complexity
 *		as much as possible, this class does NOT worry about certains things,
 *		as follows:
 *
 *		The Domain class does NOT include code to perform any kind of flow
 *		control.  When a send data command comes in to a domain, it is sent out
 *		to any attachment that is to receive it.  It is assumed that any
 *		buffering and flow control is handled by the attachments.
 *
 *		For the most part the domain class does NOT distinguish between user
 *		attachments and MCS connections.  To the domain, they are merely
 *		referred to as "attachments".  MCS connections can be either upward or
 *		downward attachments.  User attachments can only be downward
 *		attachments.  In the case where a user detaches and the domain needs to
 *		know if the whole attachment is gone or just one user, it can check an
 *		entry in its attachment dictionary to determine the type.  Most of the
 *		time it does not care.  Most confirms and indications are routed to user
 *		attachments in exactly the same way they are routed to MCS connections.
 *
 *		Domain objects do not worry about memory management.  They merely pass
 *		packet objects from place to place.  They NEVER look at the contents
 *		of the packet objects.  It is assumed that the attachments have
 *		allocated memory for the user data that is being passed around.
 *
 *		Where possible, behavior that is specific to channels and tokens has
 *		been relegated to those classes.  It is necessary for the domain to
 *		handle channel and token behavior for IDs that do not exist.
 *
 *	Private Instance Variables:
 *		Merge_State
 *			This is current merge state that the domain is in.  These states
 *			are detailed in "domain.h".
 *		Outstanding_Merge_Requests
 *			This is a counter showing the number of outstanding merge requests.
 *			The domain object uses this to know when an in-process merge is
 *			complete.
 *		Number_Of_Users
 *			This is the number of users in the domain.
 *		Number_Of_Channels
 *			This is the number of channels in the domain.
 *		Number_Of_Tokens
 *			This is the number of tokens in the domain.
 *		Domain_Parameters
 *			This is a structure that contains the currently negotiated domain
 *			parameters.  These parameters are used to validate requests, such
 *			as the adding of a new user.
 *		Domain_Parameters_Locked
 *			This is a boolean flag that indicates whether or not the domain
 *			parameters have been locked into place yet.  This locking will
 *			occur when the domain object accepts its first MCS connection.
 *		m_pConnToTopProvider
 *			This is a pointer to the attachment that represents the link to the
 *			top provider.  Note that this provider may be several hops away
 *			from the top provider, so this really just points in the direction
 *			of the top provider.  If this pointer is NULL, this THIS is the
 *			top provider.
 *		m_AttachmentList
 *			This is a list of the downward attachments that this domain is
 *			aware of.  Remeber that this list can contain any combination of
 *			user attachments and MCS connections.  They are treated equally
 *			for most things.
 *		m_AttachUserQueue
 *			This is a list of outstanding attach user requests.  It is necessary
 *			to remember these requests so that they can answered in the same
 *			order in which they arrived.
 *		m_MergeQueue
 *			During a merge operation, this queue is used to remember how to
 *			route merge confirms back to their originators.  The assumption is
 *			made that an upward provider will always respond to merge requests
 *			in the same order that they were received in (a valid assumption
 *			for our implementation).  Also note that this implementation
 *			currently only merges one resource type at a time, so only one queue
 *			is necessary.  For example, user IDs are merged, then static
 *			channels, and so on.
 *		m_ChannelList2
 *			This is a list of channel objects that correspond to active channels
 *			within this domain.  When a channel object exists, the domain lets
 *			it handle all channel related activity (such as approving who can
 *			join a channel).
 *		m_TokenList2
 *			This is a list of token objects that correspond to active tokens
 *			within this domain.  When a token object exists, the domain lets it
 *			handle all token related activity (such as approving who can inhibit
 *			the token).
 *		m_nDomainHeight
 *			This instance variable contains the height of the domain from the
 *			point-of-view of this provider.  If there are two layers of
 *			providers below this one, then the height will be two.
 *		m_DomainHeightList2
 *			This is a list of domain heights that were registered from all
 *			downward attachments.  This allows the current provider to
 *			automatically update domain height when a downward attachment is
 *			lost.
 *		Random_Channel_Generator
 *			This object is used by this domain to generate random channel IDs.
 *
 *	Private Member Functions:
 *		LockDomainParameters
 *			This member function is used to change the values of the locally
 *			maintained domain parameters structure.  Passing NULL to it causes
 *			it to set a default set of parameters.  The second parameter allows
 *			the caller to specify whether or not these new parameters are
 *			"locked" into the domain (meaning that they cannot change since they
 *			have been locked in by acceptance of the first connection).
 *		AllocateDynamicChannel
 *			This routine randomly selects a channel ID from the dynamic range.
 *		ValidateUserID
 *			This routine checks to see if the specified user is in the sub-tree
 *			of this domain.  It can optionally check to see if the user is at
 *			a specific attachment in the sub-tree.
 *		PurgeDomain
 *			This routine purges the entire domain.  This means terminating all
 *			attachments, and freeing up all resources.  This results in
 *			returning the domain to its initialized state.
 *		DeleteAttachment
 *			This routine deletes a specified attachment and frees up all
 *			resources associated with that attachment.
 *		DeleteUser
 *			This routine deletes a user from the domain.  This takes care of
 *			deleting the attachment too if this were a locally attach user.
 *		DeleteChannel
 *			This routine deletes a specific channel from the information base.
 *		DeleteToken
 *			This routine deletes a specific token from the information base.
 *		ReclaimResources
 *			This routine iterates through both the channel list and the token
 *			list, asking each if is still valid (and removing those that are
 *			not).  This allows for automatic "garbage collection" when users
 *			or attachments are lost.
 *		MergeInformationBase
 *			This routine issues the appropriate merge requests to a pending
 *			top provider during a domain merger operation.  It is also a state
 *			machine in that it remembers what has already been merged, so that
 *			the next time it is called, it can merge the next set of resources.
 *		SetMergeState
 *			This routine sets the merge state of the object, and if necessary,
 *			issues a MergeDomainIndication to all downward attachments.
 *		AddChannel
 *			This routine is used to add a new channel to the current channel
 *			list during a merge operation.
 *		AddToken
 *			This routine is used to add a new token to the current token list
 *			during a merge operation.
 *		CalculateDomainHeight
 *			This routine calculates the height of the current domain, and takes
 *			appropriate action if the height limit has been exceeded.
 *
 *	Caveats:
 *		None.

 *			This is a pointer to a token attributes structure containing the
 *			attributes of the token to be added.
 *		merge_token_list
 *			This is a list of token attribute structures for those tokens
 *			that were successfully merged into the domain information base.  It
 *			will be used to issue the merge tokens confirm downward.
 *		purge_token_list
 *			This is a list of token IDs for those tokens that were not
 *			successfully merged into the domain information base.  It will be
 *			used to issue the merge tokens confirm downward.
