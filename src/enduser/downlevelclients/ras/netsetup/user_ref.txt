Microsoft LAN Manager
Remote Access Service
User's Quick Reference


Installing the Remote Access Service

1.  Insert the Remote Access installation disk in drive A.
2.  Type a:\setup. The Setup box appears on the screen.
3.  Choose Install. The system installs the files and the Add COM Port box 
    appears on the screen.
4.  Specify a port number (internal modems are usually set to COM2) and 
    choose OK. The Configuration box appears on the screen. 
5.  Choose one or more of the following: 
    -  To accept the configuration defaults as indicated on the screen, go 
       directly to step 6. 
    -  To configure an additional COM port for Remote Access, choose 
       Add Port and specify the number.
    -  To change the modem type, choose Select Modem and select your modem 
       type.
    -  To use your computer's network adapter card and modem at the same 
       time, select the appropriate option button. This applies only to 
       dual-role computers (computers that have both a network adapter card 
       and a modem) that are running DOS and Microsoft LAN Manager Enhanced.

6.  Choose OK. The Install Complete box appears on the screen. 
7.  Restart your computer. 

For additional instructions use Setup Help or contact your system 
administrator.


Connecting to the Network

If you are running DOS and LAN Manager Enhanced on a dual-role computer, 
start at step1. If you are running DOS and any other configuration, start 
at step 2. If you are running OS/2 start at step 3.

1.  Type unload protocol.
2.  Type rasload to load the Remote Access drivers.
3.  Type rasphone to open the Phone Book. 
4.  Create and save a Phone Book entry (use Help).
5.  Connect to the network (use Help).

Note: If you plan to run the Microsoft Windows (TM) graphical environment, 
you must load the Remote Access drivers before starting the Windows 
environment.


Using the Network

You can now use the network exactly as if you were in your office.

Important: You can access data files across the telephone connection, 
but loading software programs across the network (that is, across 
the telephone line) will cause extremely long delays. Contact your 
system administrator for more details.


Disconnecting from the Network

1.  Type rasphone to open the Phone Book.
2.  From the Dial menu, choose Disconnect.


Unloading Remote Access Drivers

If you are running DOS and LAN Manager Enhanced on a dual-role computer, 
you should unload the Remote Access drivers prior to switching from your 
modem to your network adapter card, or vice versa. If you are running 
any other DOS configuration, unloading the Remote Access drivers will free 
up memory that may be needed to run other applications. To unload the 
Remote Access drivers:

Type rasload /u.

Troubleshooting

Network Access Problems

If you are denied access to your network, contact your system administrator. 
You may not have a valid user account on your LAN Manager network, or you 
may not have permission to dial in. 

Connection and Response Problems

If the Remote Access server is not responding, one or more of the following 
may be true:

-  The Remote Access server is not running. Contact your system administrator.
-  You are using an incompatible version of the Remote Access software. 
   Contact your system administrator.
-  The modem on the Remote Access server has been turned off. Contact your 
   system administrator.
-  Your modem and/or modem configurations are incompatible with the modem on 
   the Remote Access server. Contact your system administrator. 
-  Your hotel room telephone line cannot accommodate your current modem speed. 
   Use a lower baud rate or contact the hotel manager to request a direct 
   line.
-  You specified the wrong telephone number. Update your Phone Book entry and 
   redial. 
-  You did not specify a special number that gives you an outside line. For 
   example, some businesses and hotels require you to dial 9 before dialing 
   your number.
-  There is static on the telephone line. Contact your phone service provider.

Modem Problems

If your modem is not responding properly, one of the following may be true:

- Your modem has been turned off or unplugged.
- Your modem is not properly connected to your computer. 
- Your modem is in an inconsistent state. Restart or reset your modem and 
  redial.
- Your modem and/or modem cables are defective or not compatible for use with 
  Remote Access. Contact your system administrator.
- Your modem is not configured correctly. See your modem user guide or 
  contact your system administrator. 

If your modem connects at a lower baud rate than you specified, the Remote 
Access server may have a modem type different from what you are using. 
Contact your system administrator.

Unloading Problems (DOS Remote Access Drivers Only) 

If you encounter problems when unloading the Remote Access drivers, one of 
the following may be true:

-  A telephone connection still exists. The Remote Access drivers will not 
   unload if a telephone connection exists. This protects you from accidently 
   hanging up a connection and losing data. Save your data files, disconnect 
   the phone line, and then try the rasload /u command again.
-  You have an incorrect TSR unloading order. The Remote Access drivers will 
   not unload if you load a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program or 
   start the Workstation service after typing rasload. Ensure that your 
   loading order is correct.

Net805 Error 

One likely cause of this error is the following incorrect settings in MODEMS.INF:

-  Port-to-modem speed (DTE speed) is higher than modem-to-modem speed (DCE 
   speed), and
-  Flow control is OFF.

To correct the configuration, make one of the following adjustments:

-  If you want flow control to be OFF, set the DTE speed and the DCE speed 
   to the same value, or
-  If you want to enable compression, set the flow control value to ON.
