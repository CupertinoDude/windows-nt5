;
; "DriverName" keyword specifies the driver name. This keyword is required
;  and must be set to ES3210$ for the first card. For the second card,
;  this keyword must be set to ES32102$, and so on (Please see README.TXT
;  for setting up more than one card in the system).
;
; "SlotNumber" keyword specifies which slot you want to use. This keyword
;  is optional if there is only one ES3210 card in the system- the driver
;  will self-configure in this case (i.e.: SLOTNUMBER = 3 for slot 3).
;
; "MaxTransmits" keyword specifies the number of TransmitChain commands
;  which can be simultaneously queued by MAC.  Default = 6, Max. = 50.
;
; "MaxMulticasts" keyword specifies the number of multicast addresses
;  the MAC driver supports. Default = 10, Max. = 16.
;
; "MaxReceives" keyword specifies the number of receives can be queued
;  simultaneously by MAC. Default = 3, Max. = 6.

  DRIVERNAME    = ES3210$
  MAXMULTICASTS = 10
  MAXRECEIVES   = 3
  MAXTRANSMITS  = 6
