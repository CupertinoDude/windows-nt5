# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP 
#
#ÄÇïB∑Ÿfile contains the mappings of IP addresses to computer
# (NetBIOS) names.  Each entry should be kept on a^}OE†êvidual line.
# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the
# corresponding computername. The address and the LAN Manager name
# should be separated by at least one space.
#
# Note that the utilities will only recognize a finite number of
# mappings.  This current limit is 59 for Windows for Workgroups.
#
# Also, comments (like these) may be inserted on individual lines or
# following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      149.124.10.4     server1			# main office server
#      182.102.93.122	joe3			# joe's database server
