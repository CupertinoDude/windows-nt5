SETUP.TXT
=========

This file contains information about problems that may occur while
you are running Windows 95 Setup.

NOTE: It is recommended that you check your hard disk for viruses
before setting up Windows 95. If you have MS-DOS 6.x, you should
run MSAV before running Setup.

You should also turn off any screen savers you have running, and
disable any anti-virus software that is running before you start Setup.


FINDING AND FIXING HARD-DISK PROBLEMS DURING SETUP (USING SCANDISK)
===================================================================
Windows 95 Setup automatically runs ScanDisk to check for problems
on your hard disk(s). If there are problems, Setup cannot continue
until they are fixed.

NOTE: The MS-DOS-based version of ScanDisk that Setup runs may detect
long filename errors, but it cannot correct them. These errors will
not prevent Setup from proceeding, but once it completes, you should
run the new Windows version of ScanDisk from within Windows 95 to
correct these errors.

Fixing Hard-Disk Problems
-------------------------
If you see a message during Setup that says you must run ScanDisk to
fix problems on your hard disk, follow these steps to fix the problems.

If you are setting up Windows 95 over MS-DOS or a previous version of
Windows, such as Windows 3.1:

1. Quit Windows.
2. If you are setting up from floppy disks, insert Setup Disk 1 into 
   the drive, and then type the following at the command prompt:

	a:scandisk.exe /all

   where "a" is the drive that contains the Windows disk.

   If you are setting up from a CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM and then type
   the following:

        f:\win95\scandisk.exe /all

   where "f" is the drive that contains the CD-ROM.

4. Follow the instructions on your screen and fix any problems that
   ScanDisk finds.
5. Start Windows, and then run Setup again.

If you are setting up Windows 95 over a previous version of Windows 95:

1. Quit Setup.
2. On the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point 
   to System Tools, and then click ScanDisk.
3. Check your your hard disk(s) and any host drives you have for errors,
   and repair any problems found.

NOTE: If you are running Setup from MS-DOS, ScanDisk will run and you'll
be able to fix most problems from within Setup.

Problems Running ScanDisk
-------------------------
If you get a message during Setup saying that there is not enough memory
to run ScanDisk, free some conventional and/or upper memory, and then run
Setup again. If you have MS-DOS 6.x, try running MEMMAKER to free memory.

If you still don't have enough memory, or if you have other problems while
Setup is running ScanDisk, then you can bypass ScanDisk in Setup by running
Setup with the /IS option. To do this, type the following command:

	setup /is

NOTE: Bypassing ScanDisk during Setup is not recommended. If you do, 
there may be problems with your hard disk that could cause Windows 95
not to install or run correctly.

If you still have problems after running Setup with the /IS option, try 
running Setup with the /IQ option. To do this, type the following command:

        setup /is /iq


UNINSTALLING WINDOWS 95
=======================

During Setup, you'll have the option of saving your system files so that
you can uninstall Windows 95 later. If you want to be able to uninstall 
Windows 95 later, choose Yes. Setup will save your system files in a 
hidden, compressed file. If you don't need to be able to uninstall 
Windows 95 later, choose No.

You will not see this Setup option if:
- You are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows 95.
- You are installing to a new directory.
- You are running a version of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0.

NOTE: The uninstall files must be saved on a local hard drive. You 
cannot save them to a network drive or a floppy disk. If you have 
multiple local drives, you will be able to select the one you want to 
save the uninstall information on.

NOTE: If you see a message during Setup about not being able to save 
your system files, see the "Setup Error Messages" section later in this 
document.

To uninstall Windows 95 and completely restore your system to its
previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows 3.x:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control 
   Panel.
2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95, and then click 
   Remove.

Or, if you are having problems starting Windows 95, use your startup
disk to start your computer, and then run UNINSTAL from the startup
disk.

NOTE: The uninstall program needs to shut down Windows 95. If there is 
a problem with this on your computer, restart your computer and press
F8 when you see the message "Starting Windows 95." Then choose
Command Prompt Only and run UNINSTAL from the command prompt.

If Setup did not complete successfully and you want to restore your
previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows, you can run UNINSTAL from the
\Windows\Command directory on your hard disk, or from your startup disk
if you created one.

If you saved your files on a drive other than C, you can use the /w 
option to specify the drive where the files are located. For example:

        uninstal /w e:

where e: is the drive containing your previous system files that were
saved.

If Windows 95 is running and you want to remove the uninstall files to 
free up disk space (6 to 9MB), follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control 
   Panel.
2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Old Windows 3.x/MS-DOS System 
   Files, and then click Remove.

You will no longer be able to uninstall Windows 95.


IF YOU HAVE A COMPRESSED DRIVE
==============================

If you have used compression software to compress your hard disk, you
may get a message saying that there is not enough space on the host
partition of the compressed drive. Setup may have to copy some files
to your startup drive, the host for your startup drive, or the host
for your Windows drive. If you get this message, you should free up
some space on the specified drive, and then run Setup again. Try one
of the following:

- If you are setting up Windows on a compressed drive, try setting it
  up on an uncompressed drive if possible.
- Delete any unneeded files on your host partition.
- If you are running Windows 3.1 and have a permanent swap file, try
  making it smaller. In Control Panel, double-click the 386 Enhanced
  icon, and then click Virtual Memory. Then modify the size of your
  swap file.
- Use your disk compression software to free up some space on the host
  drive for the compressed drive. If you compressed your drive by using
  DriveSpace or DoubleSpace, follow these steps:

  1. Quit Windows.
  2. Run Drvspace.exe or Dblspace.exe.
  3. Select the compressed drive on whose host you want to free space.
  4. On the Drive menu, click Change Size.

  If you used other compression software, such as Stacker, consult the
  documentation that came with it.

NOTE: If you notice a discrepancy in the amount of free space reported
by Setup and the amount of space you think is available on your host
drive, it may be because Windows uses some space for creating a swap
file. This may not appear to take up any space when Windows is not
running. 

NOTE: If you create a startup disk during Setup, make sure you do not
use a compressed disk for the startup disk.

If You Have SuperStor Compression
---------------------------------
If you have compressed your hard disk by using SuperStor, Setup may not
be able to find your startup drive and install Windows 95. If you get a
message about this during Setup, uncompress your disk and remove 
SuperStor, then run Setup again.

If You Have XtraDrive Compression
---------------------------------
If you have compressed your hard disk by using XtraDrive and you are
upgrading a previous version of Windows, Setup will not be able to
install Windows 95 unless you turn off XtraDrive's write-cache. To
turn this off, carry out the following procedure:

1. Quit Windows.
2. Run Vmu.exe (XtraDrive's Volume Maintenance Utility).
3. Choose Advanced Options, and then press ENTER.
4. Set the EMS cache size to 0.
5. Set the Conventional cache size to 1 (the minimum).
6. Set Allow Write Caching to NO.
7. At the confirmation prompt, choose Yes. You will see a message 
   saying that you must restart your computer for the changes to take 
   effect.
8. Quit Volume Maintenance Utility, and then restart your computer.
9. Start Windows, and then run Setup again.


INSTALLING WINDOWS 95 OVER WINDOWS NT 
=====================================

If you are multi-booting MS-DOS and Windows NT, boot to MS-DOS, and 
then run Setup from either MS-DOS or Windows 3.x. You will not be able 
to install Windows 95 to a directory with a shared Windows 3.x/Windows NT
configuration; you will need to install Windows 95 to a different
directory.

If you are not multi-booting MS-DOS and Windows NT, you should
configure your computer to multi-boot MS-DOS and Windows NT first, and
then follow the instructions above.

If you boot MS-DOS from a floppy disk and then run Setup, you will no
longer be able to boot Windows NT; however, you can restore Windows NT
by booting from the Windows NT boot/repair disk, and then selecting the
Repair option).


INSTALLING WINDOWS 95 OVER OS/2
===============================

Setup will not run on OS/2. You need to boot to MS-DOS and run Setup 
from the MS-DOS prompt.

NOTE: If you are upgrading over OS/2 on an HPFS partition, you will
need to have your OS/2 disk 1 available during Setup.

If you are using OS/2 Boot Manager to choose operating systems at
startup, Setup will disable Boot Manager to ensure that Windows 95 can
restart the computer and complete its installation. Boot Manager can be
reactivated by running the Fdisk utility that comes with Windows 95
(see the procedure at the end of this section).

If you are not using Boot Manager, configure your computer to use Boot 
Manager, and then follow the instructions above.

If you boot MS-DOS from a floppy disk and then run Setup, you will no
longer be able to boot OS/2 after Windows 95 has been installed. You
will need to delete the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files that OS/2
uses before running Windows 95 Setup.

If you want to remove OS/2 from your computer after you have installed
Windows 95, carry out the following procedure:

1. Back up the data files you want to keep onto a floppy disk or 
   network drive.
2. Delete the files in each of your OS/2 directories and subdirectories,
   and then delete the OS/2 directories.
3. In the root directory, the following files are marked as hidden 
   system files and need to be deleted:

	Ea data.sf
	OS2ldr.msg
	OS2krnl
	OS2boot
	Wp data.sf

   In My Computer or Windows Explorer, make sure hidden files are 
   visible. To do this, click the View menu, click Options, and then 
   click Show All Files. Then delete the OS/2 files listed above.

   NOTE: If you have a version of OS/2 other than version 2.0, the 
   names of the OS/2 files on your hard disk may differ from those 
   listed above. Also, depending on which version of OS/2 you have, 
   in your root directory, you may see the following files, which you 
   can delete:

	OS2dump
	OS2ldr
	OS2logo
	OS2ver

4. Remember to empty the Recycle Bin to permanently remove the files 
   from your computer.

If Boot Manager is installed and you want to remove it, restart your 
computer, and then carry out the following procedure. (It is recommended 
that you print this file before restarting your computer.)

1. When you see the Boot Manager menu, choose to boot to MS-DOS, and 
   then run FDisk.
2. Choose to make the MS-DOS partition (C) your active partition.
3. Quit FDisk, and then restart your computer.

If you want to reinstate Boot Manager after you install Windows 95, 
carry out the following procedure:

1. On the Start menu, click Run, and then type FDISK.
2. Choose Option 2, Set Active Partition.
3. Enter the number of the Boot Manager Partition. This partition will 
   be the 1 MB non-MS-DOS partition usually placed at the top or bottom.
4. Quit FDisk, and then restart your computer as instructed.

You can now boot OS/2 at any time and change labels of partitions
in Boot Manager through the OS/2 FDisk program.


INSTALLING WINDOWS 95 ON COMPUTERS WITH LANTASTIC
=================================================

If you are running the LANtastic server, you must disable it before
setting up Windows 95. To disable the LANtastic server, either remove
the Server.exe file from your Autoexec.bat file, or type the following
command:

	server /remove

If you are running LANtastic and have either mapped or shared your
startup drive (usually drive C), Setup will not be able to determine
which drive is your startup drive and will not be able to continue.

Before running Setup, you must disable the mapping or stop sharing your
startup drive.


SETUP ERROR MESSAGES
====================

This section lists specific messages that you may encounter during Setup
and provides information about what to do next.

SU-0010, SU-0012, SU-0015, SU-0016
----------------------------------
If you receive one of these messages during Setup, please see the 
sections about OS/2 and Windows NT earlier in this document.

SU-0011
-------
If your hard disk is password-protected, Setup will not be able to 
complete successfully. You must first remove the password protection. 
For more information, see the documentation that came with your computer.

SU-0013
-------
To set up Windows 95, your startup drive must be an MS-DOS boot partition.
If your startup drive is an HPFS or Windows NT file system, you must create
an MS-DOS boot partition before running Setup. For more information, on
creating an MS-DOS boot partition, see the documentation that came with
your computer.

If you have LANtastic networking or SuperStor compression, see those
sections earlier in this document for more information.

SU0167
------
If you have a directory named Desktop in your current Windows
directory, Setup will not be able to install Windows 95 into that
directory. Windows 95 creates a directory named Desktop and uses it
for system files. If you get this message during Setup, you should
rename or move your current Desktop directory. Then run Setup again.

Standard Mode Messages
----------------------
If you get any of the following error messages, you should remove
any memory managers (such as EMM386.exe, QEMM, or 386Max) from your
Config.sys file, and then run Setup again.

	Standard Mode: Invalid DPMI return.
	Standard Mode: Fault in MS-DOS Extender.
	Standard Mode: Bad Fault in MS-DOS Extender.
	Standard Mode: Unknown stack in fault dispatcher.
	Standard Mode: Stack Overflow.

NOTE: If you still have problems, try adding EMM386.EXE back into your
Config.sys file and exclude all ranges. For example,

	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe x=A000-FFFF

If you encounter these messages or random hangs during Setup, you may 
need to turn on double-buffering in SmartDrive. Several SCSI hard drives 
and some ESDI drives require double-buffering.

To turn on double buffering, add the following line to the beginning of
your Config.sys file:

	device=c:\windows\smartdrv.exe /double_buffer+

where "c:\windows" is the path to your Windows directory.

Cannot Read Setup (.cab) Files
------------------------------
If you have Multimedia Cloaking and are installing Windows 95 from
floppy disks, Setup may not run successfully. If you see messages about
Setup not being able to read .cab files, then you should follow these 
steps:

1. Remove the line referencing Cacheclk.exe from your Config.sys and
   Autoexec.bat files.
2. Restart your computer.
3. Run Setup again.

Setup Could Not Back Up Your System Files
-----------------------------------------
If you see an error message while Setup is saving your system files, 
there may not be enough disk space, particularly on compressed disks. 
You should free up space on the drive you are saving your system files 
on (the default drive is C) by removing unneeded files.

Cannot continue on this system configuration
--------------------------------------------
If you get a message saying "Setup cannot continue on this system
configuration," you may have an older, incompatible disk partition.
Before running Setup, you will need to back up your data and then
repartition your disk.


GENERAL SETUP NOTES
===================

This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may 
prevent Setup from installing Windows 95 successfully.

Sager NP8200 or Wedge Technologies 466/DX2
------------------------------------------
WARNING: If you install Windows 95 on a Sager NP8200 or Wedge Technologies
466/DX2 laptop computer, you will not be able to use your computer, even 
if you reinstall a previous version of Windows.

Plug and Play Network Cards and 16-Bit Real-Mode Drivers
--------------------------------------------------------
When you need to run the 16-bit real-mode driver for your NIC (which is
common if you use DLC or another real-mode protocol), your Plug and Play
card may appear not to function because the 16-bit NIC drivers load before 
Windows 95 has a chance to turn on Plug and Play cards. Also, some 16-bit 
NIC drivers do not recognize Plug and Play cards (most NE2000 Plug and
Play clones fall into this category).

To use your Plug and Play card with a 16-bit NIC driver, carry out the
following procedure:
1. Run the Softset utility that comes with your Plug and Play card,
   and set the card to non-Plug and Play mode.
2. Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel and then remove the net
   card.
3. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon in Control Panel and follow the
   instructions on your screen. Windows 95 will detect your network card.

If you change to a 32-bit protected-mode NIC driver in the future, you 
can rerun Softset to turn on Plug and Play mode for your card.

Intel EtherExpress 16 NICs and PCI Computers
--------------------------------------------
You may experience system hangs or initialization problems if you are
using an Intel EtherExpress 16 NIC in a PCI computer with some Diamond
Speed Star PCI video cards. The following are excerpts from Intel's
Customer Support Database. These problems are not related to Windows 95, 
and happen on a variety of operating system platforms. In general, if
you experience other problems with your EtherExpress 16 in a PCI computer,
please attempt to replace the card before reporting the problem to
Microsoft.

If you have one of these video cards, contact your vendor about getting
a new video BIOS update.

- Diamond Speed Star PCI video card with BIOS version 1.01
- Diamond Viper PCI VGA Video Adapter
- Diamond Stealth video card, Bios v1.03

IBM Thinkpad Model 750x/755x/360x
---------------------------------
If you have one of these models, (including submodels such as C, CE, CX, 
CS, and CSE), check IBM's bulletin board or the THINKPAD forum on 
CompuServe for an updated BIOS and/or Mwave drivers for your computer 
before you install Windows 95.

If you don't upgrade your BIOS, you might have problems if you move the 
mouse while your computer is turning suspend mode on or off.


MEMORY MANAGERS
===============

If you have QEMM installed on your computer, we recommend removing it 
from your Config.sys file before setting up Windows 95. You can add it 
back after Windows 95 is installed.

The following memory managers are incompatible with or may cause
problems with Windows 95. It is recommended that you remove all
references to them from your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files and use
Emm386.exe and Himem.sys, which are provided with Windows 95, to manage
memory instead.

        Allemm4.sys - All Charge 386 Version 3.1
        HPemm386.sys and HPemm486.sys
        HPmm.sys - HP Memory Manager (must remove before Setup)
        Iemm.sys Memory Manager
        Intel(R) Expanded-Memory Emulator (Ilim386.sys)
        Maximizer Memory Manager (Maximize.com)
        NetRoom Memory Manager (RM386.sys)
	QMAPS Memory Manager Version 5.16
	UMB PRO Version 1.07

NOTE: The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT
parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Setup will fail.

NOTE: If you remove the line containing Rm386.sys from your Config.sys
file, you may need to install Himem.sys, which comes with Windows or
MS-DOS. You can do this by adding the following line to your Config.sys
file:

        device=<path>\himem.sys                                       

The <path> is the location of your Windows or MS-DOS files (for example,
C:\Windows).


DISK-CACHE PROGRAMS
===================

Before you run Setup, it is recommended that you remove any third-
party disk-cache programs and replace them with Smartdrv.exe, which 
is provided with Windows 95.

While running Windows 95, you do not need to use a disk-cache utility. 
Setup will remove most disk-cache programs for you.

If you are running one of the following disk-cache utilities, you
should remove it. In some cases, Setup will remove it for you.

  386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (Qcache.exe) (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Cache.exe Disk-Cache Utility
  Cache.sys Disk-Cache Utility
  Flash Disk-Cache Utility (Flash.exe) (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Hyperdisk Disk-Cache Utility (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Icache.sys Disk-Cache Utility 
  IBMcache.sys Disk-Cache Utility 
  Mace Disk-Cache Utility (Mcache.sys)
  Norton Speed Drive Disk Utility (SPEEDRV)
  Norton Utilities Version 5.0 and 6.1 (DISKREET, NCACHE)
  PC-Cache (PC Tools disk cache program) (must remove before Setup)
  PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (Pc-kwik.exe)
  PC_Kwik Disk Accelerator
  PC-Kwik Version 1.59 (Pck.exe, Pskscrn.exe, Pckey.com)
  PC Tools(TM) Disk-Cache Utility (Pc-cache.com)
  Secretdisk II Disk-Cache Utility (Fast512.sys) (do not use with SmartDrive)
  Super PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (Superpck.exe)


ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
===================

Some anti-virus programs can cause problems when you run Setup. Make
sure that no anti-virus programs are running while you are setting up
Windows 95. If the program is a terminate-and-stay-resident program,
remove any references to it in your Autoexec.bat, Config.sys, and Win.ini
files.

If your BIOS has built-in virus protection, you should disable it before
running Setup. To disable it, you must use the CMOS setup program for
your BIOS. For more information, see the documentation that came with
your computer.

See the notes for specific anti-virus programs below.

Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (Vsafe.com/Vsafe.sys)
----------------------------------------------------------
To remove VSAFE, remove any lines containing Vsafe.com or Vsafe.sys
from your Autoexec.bat file. Also, remove any references to Vsafe.com
or Vsafe.sys from the RUN= line in your Win.ini file.

If you are upgrading to Windows 95, you must also delete all the
Chklist.ms files that VSAFE has created before you run Setup. Because
Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off the
Vsafe write-protection option when you run Windows 95.

If you don't remove VSAFE before you set up Windows, you will see
warnings about Command.com, Win.com, and Krnl.386 when Windows starts.
If you see these warnings, ignore them and choose the update option.
For more information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.

F-PROT Professional
-------------------
Setup cannot run if F-PROT Professional is running. Remove this program
from your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files, and then check your Win.ini
file for the following line:

	load=wvirstop.exe

If you see this line, remove it. When you have finished, restart your
computer, and then run Setup again.

Norton Anti-Virus(R) 
---------------------
If you are running any version of Norton Anti-Virus, you should remove it 
before running Setup. After setup, it is recommended that you do not run
Norton Anti-Virus version 1.x, 2.x, or 3.x with Windows 95. You should
obtain Norton Anti-Virus for Windows 95.

To remove Norton Anti-Virus version 1.5:

1. In your Config.sys file, remove the following line:

	device=c:\nav\nav_.sys

2. In your Autoexec.bat file, remove C:\Nav from the PATH statement.

To remove the anti-virus features of Norton Desktop for Windows
version 3.0:

1. In your Config.sys file, remove the following line:

	device=c:\ndw\navtsr.exe

2. In your Autoexec.bat file, remove the following lines:

	c:\ndw\image.exe
	c:\ndw from the PATH statement

3. In your System.ini file, remove the following lines:

	shell=c:\ndw\ndw.exe (in the [boot] section)
	device=symevent (in the [386enh] section)

4. In your Win.ini file, remove the following line:

	load=c:\ndw\navtsrw.exe


USING TERMINATE-AND-STAY-RESIDENT (TSR) PROGRAMS AND DRIVERS
============================================================

APPEND (MS-DOS)
---------------
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows 95. It prevents Windows
and Windows-based programs from creating valid Well-Formed-Path (WFP)
names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the complete name of a
file, including the drive letter and full path specification, starting
from the root directory.)

Autocon Version 2.0e, Bootcon Version 1.60, and Boot.sys
--------------------------------------------------------
These programs enable you to select from different configurations when
you start your computer. Windows 95 Setup modifies only the first
section in your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files, so you may have to
modify these files manually after Setup if you want to use these
programs. For more information, see the documentation that came with
your program.

Cubit Version 3.01
------------------
When you are using Cubit with Windows 95, do not compress the Windows
System directory or any file that is loaded from your Config.sys file.

Before you upgrade to Windows 95, make sure that the earlier version of
Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may recompress the files
after you have successfully set up Windows 95.

Doubledisk Version 2.5
----------------------
Windows 95 may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use it with
Doubledisk. Phantom drives occur when you use Doubledisk to create a
compressed drive. For example, if you have drives A, B, and C on your
computer and you use Doubledisk to create drive F, Windows 95 and
MS-DOS recognize drives D and E as valid drives, even though they do
not actually exist. You can use the DRVOFF utility to prevent Windows
from recognizing phantom drives. To order a copy of
the DRVOFF utility, contact Vertisoft.

Infinite Disk Version 2.1
-------------------------
Infinite Disk version 2.1 does not work properly with Windows 95.
Either remove Infinite Disk software from your computer before you run
Setup, or contact your software dealer for a version of Infinite Disk
software that is compatible with Windows 95.

To remove Infinite Disk from your computer:
1. Restore any compressed files back to their original state.
2. Remove the following lines from your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat 
   files:

	iddrv.sys
	idres.exe
	protect /c

3. Restart your computer, and then run Setup again.
 
NetWare(R) NetBIOS
------------------
The NetWare NetBIOS TSR is incompatible with Windows 95 in many
configurations. In most cases, Setup will detect NetWare NetBIOS and
remove the startup command from your computer. However, if you have
NetWare NetBIOS set up to start from a location other than your
Autoexec.bat file (for example, from a batch file), Setup cannot
detect it. In this case, you need to remove NetWare NetBIOS manually.
Windows 95 includes an IPX/SPX-compatible protocol that you can use
instead of NetBIOS. For information about configuring Windows 95 to
work with it, see NETWORKS.TXT.

Newspace Version 1.07
---------------------
This disk-compression utility is incompatible with Windows 95.

Norton Desktop for Windows (Ep.exe)
-----------------------------------
If the data-recovery program Erase Protect (Ep.exe) is loaded from
your Autoexec.bat file, you need to disable it when you are setting up
Windows, especially if you are upgrading over a previous version of
Windows. Erase Protect tries to save copies of all deleted files, which
can cause you to run out of disk space while running Setup.

It is recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent swap file. 
If you are using a temporary swap file, you need to exclude files that
have a .tmp or .swp extension from erase protection.

Norton Disklock Versions 3.01 and 3.5
-------------------------------------
Norton Disklock versions 3.01 and 3.5 do not work properly with
Windows 95. Either remove this software from your computer before you
run Setup, or contact Symantec product support for a version of
Disklock that is compatible with Windows 95.

For information about how to remove Disklock from your computer, see
the documentation that came with Norton Disklock.

PC Tools Deluxe(TM) Version 7.1 (DATAMON)
-----------------------------------------
If you load PC Tools DATAMON using the \SENTRY+ option, Setup may fail
if you are low on disk space. Do not use the \SENTRY+ option when loading
DATAMON.

Do not load DATAMON after loading SmartDrive. If DATAMON is loaded after
SmartDrive, your computer may fail. See the PC Tools documentation for
information about how to unload DATAMON.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 6.0 (DESKTOP)
-------------------------------------
If you try to start PC Tools from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows,
your computer may fail or restart itself. These problems also occur if
you use MS-DOS commands from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows.

Version 7.0 of PC Tools may correct these problems. However, do not load
DESKTOP from an MS-DOS Prompt if it was loaded before starting Windows. 
If you do, your computer may fail when you quit Windows. It is recommended
that you run DESKTOP from its PIF, provided with Windows 95.

SUBST (MS-DOS)
--------------
You may encounter problems with SUBST during Setup, but you can safely
add it back after Windows 95 has been installed.

UNDELETE
--------
If you are running UNDELETE with the SENTRY option, Setup may have
problems, and there may be cases when you run out of disk space during
Setup. It is recommended that you remove UNDELETE from your Config.sys
and Autoexec.bat files before running Setup.

NOTE: The SENTRY option creates a hidden directory named Sentry. When
you delete a file, UNDELETE moves the file from its current location to 
the Sentry directory. Before removing UNDELETE from your Config.sys or
Autoexec.bat file, you should free up disk space by using the
UNDELETE /PURGE command on all drives.)

If you do not remove it, Setup will disable this command for you.


KNOWN POTENTIAL SETUP PROBLEMS
==============================

Installing Windows 95 on a 4 MB or 386 computer from floppy disks may
be very slow. To speed things up:

- Run Setup from inside Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups. Avoid
  running Setup from MS-DOS.

- If you are running a disk-compression program, such as DriveSpace or
  DoubleSpace, Setup may be very slow. Consider copying the files on 
  the floppy disks to a temporary directory on your hard disk, and then
  running Setup from your hard disk. To copy files from Disks 2 through
  12, you will need to use the EXTRACT command on Disk 1 to copy the 
  Win95_xx.cab files to your hard disk, since they are in the new
  Microsoft Distribution Media Format (DMF). Normal MS-DOS commands like 
  COPY and XCOPY won't work on these floppy disks.
  
  To copy a .cab file from a floppy disk to your hard disk, use the
  following command:

	extract /c a:win95_xx.cab c:\<TempDir>

  where <TempDir> is the location of a temporary directory on your
  hard disk.

- During Setup, if you notice that the light for an empty floppy disk 
  drive is flashing for a long time and Setup is slow, try inserting a 
  formatted floppy disk into the empty drive.

- If you encounter problems during Setup, such as Setup closing 
  unexpectedly or error messages that do not apply, try increasing the 
  size of your permanent swap file. In general, the size of your 
  permanent swap file plus the amount of RAM in your computer should 
  equal at least 14 MB for Setup to complete successfully. After you 
  change your swap file size, try running Setup again.

  NOTE: If your hard disk is compressed, you may have to increase the 
  size of your host drive before you can increase the size of your
  swap file.
