PLEASE NOTE:

This project requires two include files named LaunchServ.h and LaunchServ_i.h that are 
generated by the Launcher project located in $/MSCode/Launcher/Launcher/LaunchServ during
a build.

Since these are two separate projects and Visual SourceSafe does not provide a ready 
solution, we are utilizing the following strategy.

We have created a sub-directory in this VSS project named "DependsOn" which contains 
LaunchServ.h and LaunchServ_i.h so that we can label specific versions of these files
in this VSS project.  The obvious reason is to permit the regeneration of a given build 
from the associated project label.

If these files are changed in the LaunchServ project, it is the responsibility of the 
developer making changes in that project to proprogate them to this project (there is a 
readme.txt file in that project detailing this responsibility).

This project requires that the developer manually copy these two files from the "DependsOn"
directory to the "DependsOn" parent directory in order to compile successfully.

If you have any questions about this procedure, see either Joe Mabel or Randy Biley.
