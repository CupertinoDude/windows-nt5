# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!!!  Edit .\sources.  if you want to add a new source
# file to this component.  If you need a custom target, add it to makefile.inc
# If makefile.inc does not exist, create one.  If you need to add a global
# target, add it to makefil2.def.  If your global target, rule, flags or tools
# only affects one app, add the target to that app's make.inc, flags.inc or
# tools.inc.  There is no need to !INCLUDE makefile.inc, as it is included
# in makefile.def.

!INCLUDE $(NTMAKEENV)\makefile.def
