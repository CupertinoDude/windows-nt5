<p><font size="4">Frequently Asked Questions</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2">1. Q: What's a file extension?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">
A: A file extension is a group of 3 or 4 letters at the end of a file name. The extension is generally separated from the file name by a period (or dot). For example, in the file name RESUME.doc, the extension is "doc." The extension tells you that the file is a particular type. In this example, a .doc file is a word-processing document created with Microsoft Word or a Word-compatible program.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2">2. Q: Do I need a separate program for each file extension?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A: 
Sometimes but not always. Often programs that perform a similar function (e.g., word-processing programs, graphics editing programs, or accounting programs) can be used with more than one file extension. For example, if you have  a file called BANNER.gif, there are dozens of graphics programs that work with the file extension "gif." All you need is one of these programs to be able to view and edit .gif files.

<p><font size="2">3. Q: I used to be able to open these files? What happened? Why can't Windows open them now?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A: 
A couple of things might have happened. The most likely answer is that you once had a program on your computer that was able to work with this file extension, and now the program is gone. You might have uninstalled the program or deleted it in some other way. Or you could have installed a new program on your computer that supports this file type. New programs often make themselves the default viewer for certain file types. If you later uninstalled the newer program, you might still have a program on your computer that will open the file type, but it is no longer associated with those files because of the newer program that was once installed. To fix this problem, just right-click the file that you want to open, and choose the appropriate program from the Open With choices.

<p><font size="2">4. Q: What is the impact of this feature on my privacy?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A: 
None. When you click "Auto-Lookup," the file extension (".zip" for example) is sent to this Web site in order to start a search for supporting software and information.  No personal information is sent.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><font size="2">5. Q: I have created an application that handles this file type.&nbsp; How can I register my application for the file types it supports?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A: Email <a href="mailto:FileType@microsoft.com">fileType@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;
We will respond with the criteria.</font></p>
