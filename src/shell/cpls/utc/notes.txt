Date/Time Control Panel

==============================
Internet Time Tab
==============================

DESCRIPTION:
===============
The internet time section of the Date/Time control panel is made up of several parts:

timedate.cpl:
The CPL will allow users to change settings which are stored in the registry.  The W32Time service is then sent notifications that settings changed.
The settings are per-machine so only admins can modify this UI.  d


W32Time.dll: (NT Service)
The service will then sync at the appropriate time to the appropriate place (DC Time Server vs. internet NTP server).

time.windows.com: (WindowsUpdate service)
Our team

// This key determins how often we sync from the internet NTP server.  Not applicable to DC time servers.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer, "SpecialPollInterval", REG_DWORD = 604800 (1 once per day)

// This key determins if we try DC time server, internet time servers, or both.  AllSync is both.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters, "Type", REG_SZ = "AllSync"

// This key is used by the service to determine the server(s) to get the internet time from:

TOP QUESTIONS:
===============
Q: Why is the "Internet Time" hidden sometimes?
A: This tab will not modify the behavior when time comes from the admin controled DC time server.  I hide the tab if:
   1. The machine is joined to a domain, AND
   2. We search the domain and find a domain control that will act as a time server

Q: Why is the UI grayed out?
A: You need admin privilages to modify these values.

Q: Will this work with Personal FireWall or other NAT based Firewalls?
A: Yes.

Q: Will this work with other popular firewalls (CERN/web proxies, routers that block addresses).
A: No, most firewalls will block NTP's UDP packets on port 123.  Admins can open these ports if they want, but almost never do.

Q: Why is there a small pause before the "Internet Time" tab appears.
A: We need to search the domain for a DC that will provide the time.  This takes a few seconds on a large corp net, like Microsoft.
   We need to do this because we may need to keep the tab hidden.  Some laptops will be joined to a domain and plug and un-plug from
   the corp net.  We need the CPL to display the tab in the right cases, so we need to do a search each time.  This won't block
   the UI thread.

Q: Will this work with other popular firewalls (CERN/web proxies, routers that block addresses).
A: No, most firewalls will block NTP's UDP packets on port 123.  Admins can open these ports if they want, but almost never do.

Q: How can I force the time to sync now?
A: In a cmd.exe window, do the following commands:
   1. net stop W32time
   2. net start W32time
