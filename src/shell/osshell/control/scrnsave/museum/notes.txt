# Blocking
2. Fix window frames.
3. Hide Power Options

4. License textures.

5. Walk closer to paintings and smooth walk.
6. Is View Distored?


# High Priority
12. Check video ram and memory ram and cap painting size on screen.
8. Add nice frames and/or Make frames by parts.
7. Add more Rooms (If Doors, Middle Paintings, Benches, Exit Enter Door, Walk straight thru room, Long Room) Make room 300x100 instead of current 200x100, so it looks more like a museum. Make 200x200 room.
3. If you have a small number of pictures(3), it will render no pictures.

19. Leave door you entered.


# Medium Priority
5. Add Benches
14. Create nice arch ways.
x. Note frame stats: Textures used, triangles, etc.


# Low Priority
4. Replace textures
9. Allow Full Zoom
3. Background thread for painting conversion.
13. Clean up UI Options.  (Zoom, Stair time, Ok/Cancel, ...)
6. Add Loading Sign.  This will give time for the images to be loaded.
9. Add Lights on floor and paintings

Punted:
13. Add Enter Room with Text
6. Add Paintings in the middle

NITS:

==================================================
TODO: (MAnders)
==================================================

# Blocking
1. Add visibility testing by implementing BOOL Is3DRectViewable(pD3DDevice, D3DVECTOR vStart, D3DVECTOR vSize)
2. Walk closer to paintings and smooth walk.


# High Priority
2. Fix flashing every other frame.  Is Depth buffering not working?
3. Make the camera movement look more natural by using splines or other techniques.  This is important to make it look real.  Randomize how to stand from the paintings.  Maybe have the camera sit on a bench.
4. The software render is not working on my ATI Rage 3D cards.


# Medium Priority
5. Why does sides of the room appear to have warp?
6. Add lighting either to floor and maybe to paintings.  This will make the room much more realistic since it won't be so much the same.

# Low Priority
7. Add Bump map so paintings stand out.  This is needed to keep things realistic.



Optional:
==================
20. Add Picture Names

Perf Notes:
====================
1. Depth Buffers cause a perf hit.  We may just need to accept this.
