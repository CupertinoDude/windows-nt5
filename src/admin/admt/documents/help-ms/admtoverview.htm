<H1>Active Directory Migration Tool overview</H1>

<P>Use Active Directory Migration Tool to migrate user accounts, groups, and computer accounts:</P>

<UL>
<LI>From Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 and earlier domains to Windows&nbsp;2000 domains (interforest).</LI>
<LI>Between Windows&nbsp;2000 domains in different <A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=Forest">forests</A> (interforest).</LI>
<LI>Between Windows&nbsp;2000 domains in the same forest (intraforest).</LI>
</UL>

<P><A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=DomainMigration">Domain migration</A> is achieved by upgrading a Windows&nbsp;NT domain structure to Windows&nbsp;2000 or as part of a Windows&nbsp;2000 <A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=DomainRestructure">domain restructure</A>. Active Directory Migration Tool is used to migrate existing Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 and earlier domains into Windows&nbsp;2000. It can also be used to consolidate one or more Windows&nbsp;2000 domains into a single domain.</P>

<P>With a domain restructure you can redesign your existing domain structure to better meet the needs of your organization. Though restructure can result in any number of different outcomes, typically the result is a change in the logical relationship between your domains, and often fewer domains.</P>

<P>The recommended way to redesign your domain structure is to design and build a new Windows&nbsp;2000 forest separate from your existing domain structure and then, using Active Directory Migration Tool, migrate user accounts, groups, and computer accounts, in stages, from your production environment to the new Windows&nbsp;2000 forest. Eventually, you will decommission the old domain structure.</P>

<P><A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=DomainUpgrade">Domain upgrade</A>, or in-place upgrade, involves upgrading each domain's primary domain controller to Windows&nbsp;2000 and eventually upgrading all of the backup domain controllers to Windows&nbsp;2000. Using this method, you can upgrade all of your Windows&nbsp;NT domains directly into a new Windows&nbsp;2000 forest. A domain upgrade retains your current domain structure and no migration takes place. Active Directory Migration Tool does not support this process. However, after upgrading all Windows&nbsp;NT domains, you could redesign your upgraded domain structure by creating a new Windows&nbsp;2000 forest and using Active Directory Migration Tool to migrate the upgraded domains into the new forest. For more information about domain upgrade, see Windows&nbsp;2000 Server Help.</P>

<P>When migrating objects from computers in a <A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=SourceDomain">source domain</A> to a <A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=TargetDomain">target domain</A>, Active Directory Migration Tool installs services, called <A ID="wPopup" HREF="HELP=ADMTGlos.hlp TOPIC=Agent">agents</A>, on the source computers. These agents are dispatched from the computer on which Active Directory Migration Tool is running and are installed on other computers using the security credentials of the user account used to run Active Directory Migration Tool. Once installed, the agents run as a service using the local system security credentials. There is no need to load software on the source computers prior to the migration.</P>
