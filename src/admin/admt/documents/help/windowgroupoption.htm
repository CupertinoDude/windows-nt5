<H1>Group Options Window</H1>

<P>
Allows you to specify how the Active Directory Migration Tool handles the group migration.  These fields are defined as follows:
</P>

<DL>
	<DT><B>Copy user rights</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Copies the user rights assigned in the source domain to the target domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Copy group members</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Migrates the members of the groups you selected to migrate.  This option allows you to maintain the group membership information in the target domain.  This option is not available in the Group Mapping and Merging wizard.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Remigrate previously migrated objects</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Migrates the members of the groups you selected to migrate, even if those members were previously migrated.  This options is available only if the <B>Copy group members</B> option is checked.  This option is not available in the Group Mapping and Merging wizard.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Migrate group SIDs to target domain</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the SID of the migrated user accounts and groups in the source domain to the SID History of the new user accounts and groups in the target domain.  This feature uses a secure connection to the source domain controller.  For more information about SID History requirements, see 
<A HREF="ConceptDomMigRequirements.htm">Active Directory Migration Tool Requirements</A>.
	</DD>
	
	<DT><B>Do not rename groups</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Tries to name the migrated group the same as the group in the source domain.  If a naming conflict occurs, the options specified on the Naming Conflicts window control how the migrated group is named.  </DD>

	<DT><B>Rename with prefix</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the specified prefix to the name of each migrated group in the target domain.  The original group with the same name in the target domain remains unchanged.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Rename with suffix</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the specified suffix to the name of each migrated group in the target domain.  The original group with the same name in the target domain remains unchanged.
	</DD>
