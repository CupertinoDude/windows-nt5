			The target domain must trust all domains that are trusted by the source domain and that contain accounts that are members of local groups you migrate from the source domain.  The Trust Migration wizard allows you to compare and create the source and target domain trusts.  Migrate the trusts before you migrate user accounts, service accounts, or local groups.
			<LI>
			If you want to handle service accounts in a 
			special manner, run the Service Account Migration 
			Wizard before you run the User Migration Wizard.
			<LI>
			During the migration process, this tool truncates 
			user account names that are more than 20 characters.
			<LI>
			Password complexity functions may limit the passwords the tool can assign to a user account.  The tool can generate complex passwords that meet the minimum password length requirement and contain at least 3 lowercase letters, 3 uppercase letters, 3 numerical digits, and 3 symbols.  If the generated password does not comply with the password complexity rules in the target domain, the tool disables the migrated user account.
