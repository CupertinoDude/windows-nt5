<P>
The Active Directory Migration Tool provides a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) interface.  This interface provides many of the standard MMC features.  The MMC technology allows you to assemble tools, monitoring controls, World Wide Web pages, tasks, wizards, documentation, and other items required to administer Windows NT and Windows 2000 network components.
</P>

<P>
You can save the interface, including its various configuration settings.  When you save the interface, also known as a console, the MMC saves the settings as a file with the .msc extension.  You can then give this console file to another user, who can open it on a different computer and use the console with the saved settings.
