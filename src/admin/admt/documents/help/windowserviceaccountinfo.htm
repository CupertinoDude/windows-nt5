<H1>Service Accounts Information Window</H1>

<P>
Allows you to view the service account information you have collected through the Service Account Migration wizard.  You can select which Service Control Manager (SCM) entries you want to automatically update when the service account is migrated.
</P>

<P>
The <B>Skip/Include</B> button allows you to change the value in the <B>Status</B> column for the selected service.  To update the SCM entry for a service when the service account is migrated, ensure the <B>Status</B> column is set to <B>Include</B> for that service.
</P>

<P>
During the user migration process, you can also specify whether you want any of the displayed services updated.  If you want to skip all service accounts during the user migration process, click <B>Migrate no service accounts</B>.
</P>

<P>
If the tool was unable to update a service when it migrated the service account used by that service, the Service Account Migration wizard displays this window with the <B>Update Failed</B> status for that service.  When that service is available, you can select the service and click <B>Update SCM Now</B> to update the Service Control Manager entry.  If the SCM entry was successfully updated, the <B>Status</B> column is set to <B>Updated</B>.
