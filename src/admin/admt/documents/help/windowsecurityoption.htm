<H1>Security Translation Options Window</H1>

<P>
Allows you to specify how the Active Directory Migration Tool handles the security translation process.  These fields are defined as follows:
</P>

<DL>
	<DT><B>Replace (translation mode)</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Replaces the SID for the account in the source domain with the SID for the account in the target domain in the ACLs and SACLs of the selected objects.  This option gives the account in the target domain the same permissions to the selected objects as the account in the source domain.  This option also removes these permissions from the account in the source domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Add (translation mode)</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the SID for the account in the target domain to the ACLs and SACLs of the selected objects that contain the SID for the account in the source domain.  This option gives the account in the target domain the same permissions to the selected objects as the account in the source domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Remove (translation mode)</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Removes the SID for the account in the source domain from the ACLs and SACLs of the selected objects.  This option removes the permissions to the selected objects from the account in the source domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Migrate account SIDs to target domain</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the SID of the migrated user accounts and groups in the source domain to the SID History of the new user accounts and groups in the target domain.  This feature uses a secure connection to the source domain controller and it is not available when you migrate computer accounts.  For more information about SID History requirements, see <A HREF="ConceptDomMigRequirements.htm">Active Directory Migration Tool Requirements</A>.
