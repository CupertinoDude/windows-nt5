<H1>Naming Conflicts Window</H1>

<P>
Allows you to specify how the Active Directory Migration Tool handles accounts in the target domain that have the same name as a copied account in the source domain.  The fields are defined as follows:
</P>

<DL>
	<DT><B>Skip conflicting accounts</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Leaves the account in the target domain unchanged.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Replace conflicting accounts</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Changes properties of existing accounts in the target domain to match the properties of the account with the same name in the source domain.  If the source and target domains are in the same forest, this option is not available.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Remove existing user rights</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Ensures the account in the target domain does not have more user rights than those granted to the account with the same name in the source domain. 
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Remove existing members of groups being replaced</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Ensures the members of the migrated groups in the target domain are the same as the members of the associated groups in the source domain. 
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Rename conflicting accounts by adding</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the specified prefix or suffix to the name of the migrated account in the target domain to avoid the conflict with the other account with the same name in the target domain.  The original account with the same name in the target domain remains unchanged.
	</DD>
