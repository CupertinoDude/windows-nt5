<H1>User Options Window</H1>

<P>
Allows you to specify how the Active Directory Migration Tool handles the user account migration.  These fields are defined as follows:
</P>

<DL>
	<DT><B>Translate roaming profiles</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Copies roaming profiles from the source domain to the target domain for the selected user accounts.  This process associates the roaming user profile with the new user account in the target domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Update user rights</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Sets the user rights assigned to the new user account in the target domain to match the user rights assigned to the migrated user account in the source domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Migrate the groups that users are members of</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Migrates the groups of which the migrated user accounts are members.  This option allows you to maintain the group membership information in the target domain.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Remigrate previously migrated objects</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Migrates the groups of which the migrated user accounts are members, even if those groups were previously migrated.  This options is available only if the <B>Migrate the groups that users are members of</B> option is checked.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Do not rename users</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Tries to name the migrated account the same as the account in the source domain.  If a naming conflict occurs, the options specified on the Naming Conflicts window control how the migrated account is named.  
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Rename with prefix</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the specified prefix to the name of each migrated account in the target domain.  The original account with the same name in the target domain remains unchanged.
	</DD>

	<DT><B>Rename with suffix</B></DT>
	<DD>
	Adds the specified suffix to the name of each migrated account in the target domain.  The original account with the same name in the target domain remains unchanged.
	</DD>
