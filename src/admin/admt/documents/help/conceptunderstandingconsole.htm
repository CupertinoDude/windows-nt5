<P>
A <I>console window</I> contains the workspace of the MMC window.  You can open more than one console window in the MMC interface.  Then, you can switch between console windows.  Each console window provides a left pane and a right pane.
</P>

<P>
The left pane of a console window contains the console tree.  The console tree contains all the management components available in that console window.  The right pane of a console window provides the details or results pane.  When you select an item in the left-pane console tree, the right pane displays the details for that item.
