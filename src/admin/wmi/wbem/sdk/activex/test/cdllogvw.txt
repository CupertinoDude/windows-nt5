CDLLOGVW.EXE:

When you run into a code download failure, Run CDLLOGVW.EXE [ This is included the SDK. 
Find it the \bin directory]. This works in retail code as well. The logs are in english 
only now. 

This tool will display code download error logs/details of recently failed code downloads 
on your machine. To view a log for a failed code download, select the log by name 
and then choose "View Log". Names are CLSIDs of the controls as you see them on the 
CLASSID attribute in the OBJECT tag. You can see the parameters of the OBJECT tag by 
choosing View.Source from the browser menu. "View Log" navigates to the log file in a 
new browser window.

To delete a log file, choose "Delete Entry" in CDLLOGVW. Logs get scavenged by the 
browser cache subsystem automatically, so you don't have to worry about them cluttering 
up your hard disk space.
