1) Install IExpress from http://aicgweb/iexpress

2) Build the following files, and copy them into the directory Nova\ActiveXSuite\IExpress\SrcFiles
WBEMGrid.dll
WBEMLoginDlg.dll
WBEMUtils.dll
MOEngine.dll
WBEMClassNav.ocx
WBEMProvWiz.ocx

WBEMMultiView.ocx
WBEMNSPicker.ocx
WBEMSchemaValWiz.ocx
WBEMLogin.ocx
WBEMObjView.ocx
WBEMSingleView.ocx
WBEMHelp.ocx

NOTE: You can use the batch files 'GetRelFiles' or 'GetDbgFiles' to copy the files from their build locations

3) From explorer, launch Nova\ActiveXSuite\IExpress\WMICtls.sed

4) You'll be prompted by the IExpress wizard to open an existing SED file - Choose NEXT
5) You'll be prompted to Create a Package - Choose NEXT
6) You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to create a package - Choose NEXT
7) IExpress will take a minute to build the file WMICtls.exe (it will be in the same directory as WMICtls.sed)

The file License.txt will displayed as an end-user license agreement during installation

WMICtls.exe is a self extracting executable that installs the files mentioned in step 2 (and registers the OCX's).  It also provides a Remove option in the Control Panel's add/remove programs option.


WMICtls.exe can be run in 'quiet' mode by specifying /Q
