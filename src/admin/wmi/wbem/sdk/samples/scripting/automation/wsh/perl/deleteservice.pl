# WMI Sample Script - Delete a service (Perl Script)
#
# This script demonstrates how to delete a specific service from instances of
# Win32_Service.
#
# NOTE:  This script only applies to NT-based systems since Win9x does not support services
#
# NOTE:  Deleting a service is a permanent change to the system and this script should
#        be used with caution.  To help avoid users from accidently deleting a useful
#        service, the script has been created with the string "MyService" as the name of
#        the service to be deleted.  Change this to the name of the service you wish to 
#        delete but be sure you wish to permanently remove the service before using this 
#        script.
