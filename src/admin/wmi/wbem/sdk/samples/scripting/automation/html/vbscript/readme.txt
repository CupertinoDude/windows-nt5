VBSCLASSBROWSER.HTM README


In order to run the VBCLASSBROWSER sample you must first ensure that 
the WMI Class Navigator and WMI Login ActiveX controls are installed 
on your system.  Failure to ensure this will result in the sample 
being unable to load the controls, and they will not appear on the page.

To install the WMI controls, run one of the WMI SDK tools (for example, CIM Studio).
