Method Client
=============
This sample demonstrates the framework necessary to call a methods provider.
This code calls the "Echo" method as supported by that provider.  That method
is attached to the MethProvSamp class and it takes a string as input, returns
a copy and the length.  The class is defined in the METHPROV.MOF file which
is in the METHPROV sample.

To get the sample working, do the following;

1) Create the method provider sample "METHPROV" as outlined in the 
readme.txt file in that project.
2) Build using NMAKE. 
3) Run it.
