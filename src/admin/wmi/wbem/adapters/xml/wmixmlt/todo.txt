Code Issues:
===========

0) Reference key values 

	MapInstancePath

		If we have an instance path with at least one key which could
		be a reference (e.g. type is VT_BSTR and the value can be parsed
		as an object path) then we need to verify that the property type
		of the Class is a reference

		- retrieve the Class 
		- get the property type of the Class

		Note that reference values can be local so it may be almost
		impossible to tell from simple inspection or parsing whether
		the value represents an object path.

		In general we would need the class prototype to decide for sure.

		Also the specification requires that we always construct 
		absolute paths for reference values.

1) Add MakeStandalone attribute to control (default FALSE)

2) Add includeStandalone attribute to control (default FALSE) 

3) Add localOnly flag to control (default FALSE)

4) When calling ExecQuery (or EnumerateInstances with a property list)
   and returning ASSOCIATION class or instance, it is possible that
   the returned object may be invalid since filtering causes it not
   to have at least two REFERENCE elements.

   Control should "dumb down" object to a CLASS or INSTANCE in that
   case.

   This should be documented in the specs.
