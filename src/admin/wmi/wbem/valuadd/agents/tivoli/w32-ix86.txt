 Tivoli Management Environment (TME 10) Endpoint*

				   for

                       Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x,4.0 and Windows 2000*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



TME 10 Endpoint (LCF) is a lightweight client framework which allows limited invocation

of methods within the Tivoli Framework.  LCF consists of the LCFd (a long

running daemon-like NT service) and the LCF software development kit

(a collection of libraries and headers for development of LCF methods).



Firewall support:



The TME10 Endpoint client will not work correctly through firewalls.

Most firewall software products (like SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) allow you to

configure the client to bypass the firewall when interacting with machines

local to the client.  Please consult the documentation for your firewall

software for more details.
