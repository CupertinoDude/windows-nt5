Description:
This demo allows the user to select different instances of Win32_LogicalDisk 
that have been persisted as CIM XML documents and apply different XSL stylesheets 
to those documents.  Choose an XML document and a XSL stylesheet on the left and display
the data on the right.

This demo is a good example of using XSL to offer different views on XML.  Many times, the 
web designer will want to display different data to different consumers.  Through XSL this can 
be done without altering the original XML document or the HTML page used to load that document.


Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or greater on Win32 or Unix platforms to view this demo.
