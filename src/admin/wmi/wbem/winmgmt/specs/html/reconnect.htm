<H1>Reconnecting to standalone providers</H1>
<P>In WBEM V1, whenever a standalone (local or remote) instance, class, method, or property provider shut down, CIMOM was not able to use this provider again.  Starting with WBEM build 619, this problem is fixed.  </p>

<p>Whenever a request to a provider returns an error code with a facility other than FACILITY_ITF (all documented WBEM error codes have this facility), CIMOM assumes that a system problem is preventing communications with a provider, releases the provider, reconnects, and re-issues the request.  If the request fails again, no further attempts are made and the request fails.</P>

<p>This behavior was already implemented in V1 for event consumers.  <strong>This behavior is not supported for event providers: once an event provider is down, it will not be restarted again</strong>
