<P>Currently, the WINMGMT service is configured to start as a manual service when installed by the &quot;in the box&quot; Win2K setup.  Due to the need to have WINMGMT always available so as to support perf counters, it would be better to have WINMGMT run as an automatic service.</P>
<P>The first time that WINMGMT runs as a service, it changes its startup setting to AUTOMATIC and it immediately starts to act like an automatic service in that it will not stop after all the clients have disconnected.&nbsp; Note that this does not apply to the times when WINMGMT is run during setup or is intentionally executed as a regular EXE.</P>
<P>Should the user changes the setting back to manual after WINMGMT has changed it to automatic, WINMGMT will not change the setting again unless it is reregistered.</P>
<P>To control this, there is a new registry entry value HKLM\software\microsoft\wbem\cimom|AlreadySetToAuto.  When WINMGMT is registered, this is set to &quot;0&quot;.  When the startup setting is changed, this value is updated to &quot;1&quot;.</P>
<P>The following pseudo code is run whenever WINMGMT is run as a service.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>void SetToAuto()</P>
<P>{</P>
<P>&#9;if(HKLM\software\microsoft\wbem\cimom| "WMISetup" != &quot;0&quot;)</P>
<P>&#9;    return;</P>
<P>&#9;if(HKLM\software\microsoft\wbem\cimom| " AlreadySetToAuto " != &quot;0&quot;)</P>
<P>&#9;    return;</P>

<P>         schSCManager = OpenSCManager(….);</P>
<P>        schService = OpenService(schSCManager, "WinMgmt", SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS);</P>
<P>        if(ChangeServiceConfig(  schService, …,  SERVICE_AUTO_START, …);</P>
<P>        {</P>
<P>&#9;   gbRunningAsManualService = FALSE;</P>
<P>&#9;   rWINMGMT.SetDWORDStr( "AlreadySetToAuto", 1);</P>
<P>        }</P>
