<H1>Changes to the semantics of the user security settings</H1>
In WBEM V1, every user (instance of __User in the root\security namespace) had certain security settings associated with it.  In particular, the user's access level could be: ReadOnly, WriteInstances, WriteClasses.
The interpretation of those settings was that a user whose level is, say, ReadOnly, may not modify any instances, whether statically stored in the CIMOM database, or provided by a dynamic provider.  The same applied to classes.
As of right now, the interpretation of these settings changes in two important ways:

<ol>
<li>Security settings apply <I>only</I> to objects stored in the static database.  That is, if a user has ReadOnly access, that means that the user does not have the right to create any instances in the database.  However, the user may still have the right to create or modify instances provided by a dynamic provider. Similarly, a user at the WriteInstances level will not be able to create or modify static classes, but can still create and modify classes provided by dynamic class providers.  Dynamic providers (class or instance) enforce their own security via impersonation (see another document).
<li>In order to create and delete namespaces, you now need to have WriteClasses security level, not WriteInstances as in V1.
</ol>
