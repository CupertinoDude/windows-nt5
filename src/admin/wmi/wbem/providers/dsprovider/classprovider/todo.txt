TO DO LIST
==========

2. Make the interfaces DLDAPCache::GetClass() and EnumerateClasses() uniform. One
returns a list of class names, other returns CLDAPClass object. As a result change the
GetObjectAsync() and CreateClassEnum() functions too.
3. Implement caching for properties, and remove initializiation overhead.
5. Remove unnecessary functions from all classes
6. Remove unnecessary literals from all classes and move them to attribute.h
7. Add stuff about mapping auxiliary classes to Func. Spec.
10. Make all association members strong object refs (both class and instance provider)
11. Query Fails for special characters.
12. Indicate part by part in large sets
13. Remove duplication in association.
14. Associators query doesnt work.
15. Error objects.
16. Optimize mapping of Auxiliary classes.

1. Optimize ExecQuery implementation in instace provider?
2> Merge DLLs.
4. New ADS Types
5. ADS_UTC_TIME is no longer a string. It is SYSTEMTIME now
6. CHeck associations for class / instance provider
7. Range_Upper and Range_Lower not being mapped?
