Msistuff.exe is a configuration utility for Setup.exe, the bootstrap executable for Microsoft&#0174; 
Windows&#0174; Installer version 2.0. Msistuff provides the user with the ability to configure
certain resources within setup.exe. Setup.exe uses the values of these resources to download and
install Windows&#0174; Installer packages from the web.

Thus, using Msistuff.exe, anyone can quickly configure setup.exe to download and install a package
of their choice from the web without modifying or recompiling setup.exe.
