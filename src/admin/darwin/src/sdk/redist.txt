======================================
Windows Installer Redistributables 2.0
======================================

The Windows Installer redistributables may only be redistributed as part 
of INSTMSI.EXE.  You may not redistribute any of the DLLs in INSTMSI.EXE 
except by using INSTMSI.EXE.  You may not modify INSTMSI.EXE

INSTMSI.EXE is a self-extracting executable that will install the 
Windows Installer redistributables only if there is not a more recent 
version of the DLLs in the system directory. INSTMSI.EXE will write the 
registry keys required by Windows Installer.

In addition to the rights granted in Section 1 of the Microsoft Platform 
Software Development Kit End User License Agreement ("Agreement"), with 
respect to the Redistributable Code, you have the following 
non-exclusive, royalty free rights subject to the
Distribution Requirements detailed in Section 1 of the Agreement:

(1) You may distribute WIN9X\INSTMSI.EXE for use only on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME

(2) You may distribute WINNT\INSTMSI.EXE for use only on Windows NT Version 4 and Windows 2000
