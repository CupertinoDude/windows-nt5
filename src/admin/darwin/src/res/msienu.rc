// ** Think carefully before adding strings here. We're going to have a localized version of the 
// ** string for many languages stored in our DLL. 
//
// Before adding a string here, consider:
//
// 1) Is there a way you can derive the string?
// 2) Is there a system error message that's close enough to the string you need?
// 3) If your string is an error message, does it make more sense to create a new system error message
