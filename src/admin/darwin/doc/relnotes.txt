02-08-24  cnapier      Bug 690542 - XP SP1: Reboot from winlogon process (machine-deployed with reboot req.)
                       results in hung machine on shutdown due to winlogon assumption that reboot requests
                       in winlogon are redirected requests from csrss across FUS\TS session that requires
                       waiting on the session to exit before the reboot can happen.

                       to build language list.  Now allows language neutral to be used in a set of
