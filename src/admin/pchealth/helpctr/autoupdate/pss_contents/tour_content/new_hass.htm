Plugging a new scanner or printer into your computer should be as easy as plugging a new lamp into the wall. And when you turn it on, it should just work. Computer users like you have known all along that hooking things up to the computer and getting them to work right has been way too hard. Now manufacturers of computers, peripheral hardware, and software agree. Microsoft Windows 98 Millennium supports the computer industry's emerging solution, which is borne out in a few simple ideas: 

<p class="toccon">
Make all the plug-in ports on the back of new computers the same. The port that the industry has settled on is called USB (universal serial bus). Some computer manufacturers refer to such computers as "legacy free." </P>

<p class="toccon">
Make all the plug-in cords for new equipment the same, capable of fitting into the new USB ports in the backs of legacy-free computers. </P>

<p class="toccon">
Design Microsoft Windows so that older equipment—such as a printer or your favorite ergonomic mouse—can be used on new computers. All that's needed is a USB adapter. You just place the USB adapter on the end of the equipment's communications cord (not its power cord), and then plug it into a USB port on the back of your computer. Any well stocked computer or electronics store carries adapters.</P>


<p class="toccon"><b>What does this mean for you?</b> </P>

<p class="toccon">
Adding equipment is easy. You don't have to worry about plugging this particular thing into that particular port. They're all the same, so take your pick. </P>

<p class="toccon">
It just works. Unlike before, the chance of one piece of equipment getting in the way of another's operation is all but eliminated. That means fewer unexpected surprises, frustrations, and calls for assistance. </P>

<p class="toccon">
No need to restart! You don't have to restart the computer after adding something new. Windows recognizes it instantly. </P>

<p class="toccon">
Quick changes. Just like a a wall socket, you can unplug one thing and plug in another, and it works. Incidentally, no electrical current passing through the port, just information—a conversation between Windows and the item you've plugged in. </P>
