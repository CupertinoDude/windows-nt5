Why have a home network?  
If you have two or more computers at home and you haven't considered a home network, now is the time. You may be tired of carrying floppy disks between computers to print, for example, or you may wish you had Internet access or an e-mail account on more than one computer. You may want to collaborate on projects with another person in your household. And there you'd like to be able to play multi-player games too.
