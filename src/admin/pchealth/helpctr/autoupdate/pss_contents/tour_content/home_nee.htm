Windows Millennium Home Networking software makes it easy to create a home network. 

You don't have to be a computer whiz to set up a basic home network. To start, you'll need the following:

[BB suggestion: If it's supported, the below items could be DHTML windowshade-type items, meaning each boldface string below could be a link. Clicking the link would display the accompanying paragraph of text.]


Home networking hardware  There's a growing variety of home networking hardware that's both affordable and easy to set up. Some options use existing wiring, such as your phone lines or power lines to connect computers. Other options are wireless, using radio signals to transmit data among computers, similar to cordless phones. Or you can use an Ethernet-based solution. Consult with your local computer store for the best option for you.

Computers   Use two or more, running either Microsoft Windows Millennium, Windows 98, or Windows 95. Each computer must be network-ready, with a network adapter. A network adapter physically connects a computer to a network, and can be an expansion board that plugs into a computer, or it can be built in to the main board (motherboard) of a computer. 

If you want to share an Internet connection, you'll also need the following:

Communications hardware  This may be a traditional dial-up modem and a phone line, or a high-speed connection, such as cable or digital subscriber line (DSL), which is several times faster than a traditional modem.

Internet access  This may be through an Internet service provider such as MSN or, if you have a high-speed connection, a cable provider or phone company.

It's best to set up the computer running Windows Millennium as the one with the Internet connection. The other computers will gain access to the Internet through it.
