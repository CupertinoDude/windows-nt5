If you need help solving a problem with your computer, it's likely that other people have had that problem, too. And it's likely that they've solved their problem. With Support Automation, those solutions can be made available to you. Support Automation can help you get to the bottom of your problem fast, without the potential inconvenience of a lengthy support call. 
<p class="toccon">
Here's how it works: 
<p class="toccon">
Computer and related equipment manufacturers compile a list of the problems that customers have with their products. 
They develop step-by-step solutions for those problems and make them available on the Internet. 
You get to these solutions not by searching all over the Internet for them, but simply by clicking <b>Start</b> and then clicking <b>Help</b>, which opens the Help and Support window. 
Help and Support provides links to various manufacturers, leading to solutions to common problems. 
You just find your problem among those the manufacturer has listed, and follow their process for solving it.
