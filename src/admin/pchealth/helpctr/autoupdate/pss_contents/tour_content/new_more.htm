We have made hundreds of behind-the-scenes improvements to Windows 98 Millennium. And while the details might be about as exciting as watching grass grow, the total effect is exciting indeed—Windows is faster, more fun, and more trouble-free than ever before. </P>

<p class="toccon">For example, file settings that it used to read from the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files as the computer starts have all been moved within Windows itself so your computer starts faster. </P>

<p class="toccon">Windows also now protects important system files in a new way by using System File Protection, keeping your computer running efficiently. You see, many products make use of the same core Windows system files. But sometimes, when you install a product, it tries to replace such a file with its own version. If that version is older than the one it's replacing, it might lack capabilities that other programs rely on. This can mean poorer performance - or worse, making another product not work. </P>

<p class="toccon">System File Protection works in the background to make sure such things don't happen. And this ensures that your copy of Windows - and your favorite programs - operate smoothly and quickly. </P>
