One great feature about the desktop is that you can personalize it - from simply changing the color or adding a background pattern or photograph, to making your desktop come "alive" by adding dynamic content such as news headlines or stock quotes that are updated at regular intervals from the World Wide Web. </P>
<p class="toccon">And personalization isn't just for fun: You can also add the programs you use most often to the Start menu and place shortcuts to your favorite programs and documents to the desktop so they're always just a click away.</P></FONT>


<!--<p class="toccon">One of the best things about the desktop is that you can personalize it. For example, you can change the color and add wallpaper or a picture. You can also add icons and shortcuts to your favorite programs and documents.</P>

<p class="toccon">Customize your desktop further by adding commonly used items to the top of the Start menu and including "active" content that is updated at regular intervals from the World Wide Web.</P>-->
