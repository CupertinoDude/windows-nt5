Imagine you're late for a meeting and are in the middle of crunching numbers in a spreadsheet. Or you're touching up a photo and suddenly have to dash out the door to pick up the kids. Can you leave your computer and be confident that, when you return, everything will be just as you left it? </P>

<p class="toccon">
The answer is yes. But only if you are using Hibernate or Standby—two features of Windows 98 Millennium. </P>

<Div class="tocconb">Hibernate</div>
<p class="toccon">
Hibernate lets you turn off your computer so that when you restart it, everything is restored exactly as you left it—including unclosed programs and documents. Even if you're buried in figures in a spreadsheet, there's no need to fret over a hasty shutdown. And you save power and wear and tear on your computer. </P>

<p class="toccon">
If colleagues or phone calls interrupt you a lot, you might also consider putting your computer into automatic hibernation, after a specified number of minutes. </P>

<p class="toccon">
When you put your computer into Hibernate mode: </P>


<UL><LI>Everything in memory gets saved on the disk </LI>
<LI>The monitor and hard disk get turned off </LI>
<LI>The computer gets turned off </LI></UL>


<Div class="tocconb">Standby</div>
<p class="toccon">
Standby is used mainly for conserving power, particularly battery power in laptop computers. It also gives you the benefit of getting right back to your work without waiting for the computer to restart. Standby turns off your monitor and hard disks, placing your entire system in a low-power state. When you return to your computer, it quickly comes out of Standby mode and your desktop is restored exactly as you left it. Please be aware though that, unlike Hibernate, Standby does not store unsaved information on your hard disk; it's stored in the computer memory. If there is an interruption in power, information in memory is lost. So before putting your computer on Standby, you should save your files. </P>

<p class="toccon">
When you put your computer into Standby mode: </P>


<UL><LI>The computer switches to a low power state </LI>
<LI>Devices such as the monitor and hard disks are turned off </LI>
<LI>Information in computer memory is not saved to the disk </LI></UL>
