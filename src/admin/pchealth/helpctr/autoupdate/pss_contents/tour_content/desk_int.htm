<FONT COLOR=RED><div class="toccon">One thing you'll want to do is quickly start your programs and open your documents.  The Start button  is your entry point.  It's located on the bar across the bottom of your screen, called the taskbar.  Look there to find out what programs are currently open:  each one has a button you can click to switch to it immediately. You can also quickly tell the time with the handy clock, adjust the volume on your speakers (if your computer has a sound card), and change a few other settings by using the various icons on the taskbar.</div> </FONT>
