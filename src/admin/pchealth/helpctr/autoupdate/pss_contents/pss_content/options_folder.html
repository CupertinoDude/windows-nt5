<P>When you install Windows Millennium, you may notice that a new folder is created by Windows Setup. This folder is created by default in the following path:</P>

<P>&lt;Drive&gt;\&lt;Windows Folder&gt;\Options\Install</P>

<P>The contents of this folder are the Windows Cabinet (cab) files that Windows uses during setup, and when you add or remove a component of windows such as games, mouse pointers, screen savers, and so on. This type of folder is commonly referred to as a flat folder.</P>

<P>The purpose of this folder and it's contents is to decrease the time that it takes to perform actions such as installing Windows components, installing drivers for new hardware, and anything else which may require the original Windows installation media.</P>

<P>This folder is not required by Windows after Windows Setup has completed, it is only there for your convenience. If the hard disk that contains your Windows folder is low on disk space, you may delete this folder to free up disk space without adversely affecting your installation of Windows Millennium.</P>
