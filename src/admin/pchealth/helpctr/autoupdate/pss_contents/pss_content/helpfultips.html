</B></FONT><LI>Buy a quality power strip for your computer and peripherals (printer, speakers, etc.). </LI>
<LI>Collect the following items and keep them together in a safe place: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>All labels with serial numbers. You may need these numbers later. </LI>
<LI>All disks, manuals, and other documentation included with your computer. </LI>
<LI>The device and system summary report from Device Manager. For information about how to print this report, <A HREF="DevMan.asp">click here</A>. </LI></UL>

<LI>Avoid plugging your computer into an outlet on the same circuit as a major appliance (or your Christmas lights). </LI>
<LI>Create a Millennium Startup disk. To do so, click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs, click the Startup Disk tab, and then click Create Disk. </LI>
<LI>Buy a current anti-virus program. For example, McAfee Anti-Virus. Periodically scan for viruses using the latest virus signatures and allow the program to remove any viruses that it finds. For additional information about computer viruses, <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q129/9/72.asp">click here</A>. </LI>
<LI>Periodically run the ScanDisk tool to check your hard disk for errors and the Disk Defragmenter tool to optimize file access. The easiest way to do this is to use the Maintenance Wizard. To start the Maintenance Wizard, click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Maintence Wizard. Using Maintence Wizard, you can schedule these tasks to run when you are not using your computer. </LI>
<LI>Periodically back up all critical data on your hard disk using Microsoft Backup.&nbsp; To start Microsoft Backup, click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Backup. </LI>
<LI>Use the Registry Checker tool to make a back up copy of your registry before you install new hardware or software. To do so, click Start, click Run, type Scanreg, and then click OK. Click Yes when you are prompted to save a copy of your registry. This enables you to revert to a previous copy of your registry if installing new hardware or software prevents you from starting or using Windows or other programs. </LI>
<LI>Read the Readme.txt files included with your software and print them out if you can. </LI>
<LI>Register a product online when the option is available. </LI>
<LI>If you have intermittent problems with sound, video, or printing, ensure the cables connecting the device to your computer are secure.</LI>
<LI>Take advantage of the Troubleshooting Wizards included in Millennium. </LI></UL>
