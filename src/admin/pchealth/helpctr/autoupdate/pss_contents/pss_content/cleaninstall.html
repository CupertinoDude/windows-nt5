<H3>Minimum Hardware Requirements to Install Millennium</H3>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The minimum hardware requirements include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Pentium 150 or faster processor </LI>
<LI>32 megabytes (MB) of memory </LI>
<LI>200 MB of free hard disk space </LI>
<LI>CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.</LI>
<LI>3.5-inch high-density floppy disk drive</LI>
<LI>Video adapter and monitor that support VGA or higher resolution</LI>
<LI>Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device</LI></UL>

</FONT><H3>System Updates, Device Drivers, and Other Considerations</H3>
<H4>CMOS Anti-Virus Utility</H4>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>It is important that you disable any CMOS anti-virus utility that is enabled on your computer before you run Setup. If you are not sure if this feature is enabled on your computer, review the documentation included with your computer, or contact the computer's manufacturer. </P>
</FONT><H4>Drive Overlay Software</H4>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>If your computer uses drive overlay software to enable large hard disk support, the drive overlay software must be installed before you install Millennium. To install the drive overlay software, review the documentation included with the software, or contact the software's manufacturer. </P>
</FONT><H4>System Updates and Device Drivers</H4>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>To ensure that your hardware and software is compatible with Millennium, verify that you have the latest drivers, Basic Input Output System (BIOS), or patches for your hardware and software before you run Setup.<BR>
<BR>
If you have a computer that has proprietary hardware and you try to install Millennium on a clean hard disk, you may receive error messages. Before you install the retail or upgrade version of Millennium on your computer, check with the hardware manufacturer and verify that there are no known issues. Also, if your current version of Windows came preinstalled and bundled with a software package that is on a Restore disk provided by the hardware manufacturer, you may not be able install the programs that are on the Restore disk.<BR>
<BR>
In these circumstances, use the hardware manufacturer's Restore disk to install Windows 95 and the included programs first, and then run Setup from the Millennium Upgrade version. Please refer to your original hardware documentation if you are not sure how to run the Restore program.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NOTE</B>: Running the Restore program may erase all of the data on your hard disk. </P>
</FONT><H4>Real-Mode CD-ROM Support</H4>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The Millennium Startup disk and Boot disk have generic CD-ROM drivers that work with most CD-ROM drives. The Millennium Startup disk contains generic, real-mode ATAPI CD-ROM and SCSI drivers that cause CD-ROM drives to be available after you boot from the Millennium Startup disk. These CD-ROM drivers are not guaranteed to work with all CD-ROM drives. They may work as a replacement if the real-mode CD-ROM drivers included with your CD-ROM drive are not available. If these drivers do not work with your CD-ROM drive, please review the documentation included with your hardware, or contact your hardware manufacturer. </P>
</FONT><H3>Preparing the Hard Disk for Millennium installation</H3>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>NOTE</B>: The following information applies to preparing an empty hard disk for the installation of Millennium. If you use the following steps on a hard disk that is not empty, all of the data on that hard disk will be erased.<BR>
<BR>
Before you install Millennium on an empty hard disk, a primary partition must be created and then a file system must be formatted on that partition. Each allocated space on the hard disk (primary partition or logical drive) is assigned a drive letter. Millennium supports the FAT16 and FAT32 file systems. When you run the Fdisk utility on a hard disk larger than 512 MB, you are prompted to choose a file system.<BR>
<BR>
The FAT16 file system has a maximum of 2 gigabytes (GB) for each allocated space, or drive letter. For example, if you use the FAT16 file system and have a 6-GB hard disk, you can have three drive letters (C, D, and E) each with 2 GB allocated.<BR>
<BR>
The FAT32 file system supports drives up to 2 terabytes in size and stores files on smaller sections of the hard disk than does the FAT16 file system. This results in more free space on the hard disk. The FAT32 file system does not support drives smaller than 512 MB.<BR>
