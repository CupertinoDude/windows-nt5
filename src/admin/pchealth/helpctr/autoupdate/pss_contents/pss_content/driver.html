<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Learning about device drivers</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>A device driver is code that the operating system uses to control disk devices, display adapters, mice, modems, fax machines, printers and other hardware. There are several types of drivers, here we’ll address universal drivers and mini-drivers.</P>
<P>A universal driver includes most of the code necessary for devices in a particular class of devices (such as printers or modems) to communicate with the appropriate operating system components (such as the printer or communications subsystems). A mini-driver is the relatively small and simple driver that contains any additional instructions needed by a specific device. In many cases, however, the universal driver for a particular category of devices also includes the code needed to operate devices designed to the most common standard for that category. For example, the Unimodem driver works with all modems supporting AT commands.</P>
<P>Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition and Millennium use a universal driver. A universal driver includes most of the code necessary for devices in a particular class of devices such as printers or modems to communicate with the appropriate operating system components. For example: the pointing (mouse) or communications (modem) subsystems. </P>
