<FONT SIZE=2><P>A dynamic-link library (DLL) file is an executable file that allows programs to share code and other resources necessary to perform particular tasks. Microsoft Windows provides DLL files that contain functions and resources that allow Windows-based programs to operate in the Windows environment. </P>
<P>DLLs most often appear as files with a .DLL extension; however, they may also have an .EXE or other extension. For example, Shell.dll provides the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) drag and drop routines that Windows and other programs use. Kernel.exe, User.exe and Gdi.exe are examples of DLLs with .EXE extensions. They provide code, data or routines to programs running in the Windows operating system. For example, one of these files provides the "CreateWindow" function that programs use when a new window is created on the screen. In Windows, an installable driver is also a DLL. A program can open, enable, query, disable and close the driver based on instructions written in the DLL file. <BR>
<BR>
DLLs may be found in the Windows directory, Windows\System directory or in a program's directory. <BR>
<BR>
If a program is started and one of its DLL files is missing or damaged, you may receive an error message like: "Cannot find xyz.dll". If a program is started with an outdated DLL file or mismatched DLL files, the error message "Call to undefined dynalink" may be displayed. In these situations, the DLL file must be obtained and placed in the proper directory in order for the program to run correctly.</P>
