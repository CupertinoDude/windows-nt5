<P>When you try to upgrade a computer with a compressed drive, you may receive the following error message:</P>

<DIR>

<P>Windows is installed on a compressed drive and cannot be upgraded to Windows Millennium until the compression is removed. Please use DriveSpace to remove the compression on this drive. Message SU0320</P>

<P>This is by design. To work around this issue, use the DriveSpace Utility to remove the compression on the drive and then run setup again. <B>NOTE</B>: You may want to backup any important data prior to uninstalling DriveSpace. To launch DriveSpace:</P>

<P>1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools and then click DriveSpace.</P>

<P>2. Click to select the compressed drive.</P>

<P>3. On the Drive menu, click Uncompress and follow the instructions on the screen.</P>

<P>If the option to uninstall DriveSpace is not available, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</P>
