I propose that before each release of the tool, the following must be tested. 
Some tests on Win2K and some on Whistler. Try all of these first as MSFT Core
(Authoring Group < 1000), then as OEM (Authoring Group = 10001).

o Create/Delete Stop Signs: OEM can't do.
o Create/Delete Stop Words: OEM can't do.
o Create/Delete/Modify Keywords: OEM can't do last 2.
o Create/Delete/Modify Synonym Sets: OEM can't do.
o Cut/Paste of a Node: Menu + right click
o Cut/Paste of a Topic: Menu + right click
o Copy/Paste of a Node: Menu + right click
o Copy/Paste of a Topic: Menu + right click
o Create HHT (Full) and CAB: Make sure that the CAB is acceptable.
o Create HHT (Delta) and CAB: Make sure that the CAB is acceptable.
o Filter by SKU
o Generate Report (all selections)
o Mark Nodes and Topics (all selections): Try this for each of the 3 MDBs.
o Create/Modify/Delete Milestone: OEM can't do.
o Help
o Create Topic: Button + right click
o Create Node: Button + right click
o Modify Topic
o Delete Topic: Button + right click
o Modify Node created in current milestone
o Delete Node created in current milestone: Button + right click
o Modify Node created in an old milestone (this must fail with a good error 
    message)
o Delete Node created in an old milestone (this must fail with a good error 
    message): Button + right click
o Navigate Link for each SKU: Try this for each of the 3 MDBs.
o Add/Remove keywords button to Add Keywords (Create and Add at the same time): 
    You can Associate a Keyword with a Node/Topic, even if the Keyword doesn't 
    exist. It is Created and Associated in one step.
o Add/Remove keywords button to Add Keywords (An existing Keyword; not created 
    now)
o Add/Remove keywords button to Remove Keywords
o Combo box on main taxonomy screen to Add Keywords (Create and Add at the same 
    time)
o Combo box on main taxonomy screen to Add Keywords (An existing Keyword; not 
    created now)
o "Visible" checkbox. If its unchecked for an ancestor, then descendents must 
    have it unchecked, and disabled.
o No one can modify/delete a Node/Topic that was created by a different
    Authoring Group.
o Edit/Find:
    o My authoring group
    o Title and URI = "xxx"
    o My authoring group AND Title/URI = "xxx"
o HHC/HHK import
    As done by Server:
        Import windows.hhc/Fast
        Import HHKs/Fast
        Propagate Keywords: Did keywords get propagated?
    Import single HHK title/Slow: keywords propagated?
    Drop HHK onto existing HHK: old HHK replaced?
o XLS import
o CHM import followed by HTM import
o Few copy/pastes of nodes, then refresh. Depth is correct?
o Mark as subsite: bolded? Create child Node/Topic. Mustn't be subsite. Topic 
    mustn't have subsite checkbox.
o Two topics having same URI. Assign keywords to one. Propagated automatically 
    to other? Delete a keyword from one. Same happens on the other?
o Modify a Topic in one window. Modify same thing in other window. Allowed?
    Try to delete a Node/Topic that was modified in another window.
    Try to change a Node/Topic that was modified in another window.
    Try Move Into/Move Above/Move Below with a Node/Topic that was modified in 
        another window.
o Move things around, both Above and Below, then refresh.
o OEM test:
    Copy desktop.mdb dell.mdb
    In dell.mdb, set Authoring Group to 10001.
    In dell.mdb, create 2 nodes and descendents under Node A. Move them around 
        under same parent. Create 2 nodes and descendents under Node B. Move 
        them around under same parent.
    In desktop.mdb, rename node A.
    Copy desktop.mdb dell2.mdb
    In dell2.mdb, set Authoring Group to 10001.
    Run this script:
        Option Explicit
        const DB1_MDB = "c:\temp\dell.mdb"
        const DB2_MDB = "c:\temp\dell2.mdb"
        Dim clsAuthDatabase
        Dim clsHHT
        Set clsAuthDatabase = CreateObject("AuthDatabase.Main")
        Set clsHHT = clsAuthDatabase.HHT
        clsAuthDatabase.SetDatabase DB1_MDB
        clsHHT.ExportHHT "c:\temp\foo.xml"
        clsAuthDatabase.SetDatabase DB2_MDB
        clsHHT.ImportHHT "c:\temp\foo.xml"
    Does dell2.mdb look correct? Node A has 2 Dell nodes in correct place? What 
        about Node B Dell nodes?

Create file Foo.hhk:

    ! is stop sign anywhere
    : is stop sign at end of word
    but, by, and came are stop words

    Remove operator shortcuts: Se!tt!ing hup:::  permissions:  but   by came! and:    : au:dit!ing:
    Remove stop signs:         Se tt ing hup     permissions   but   by came  and     : au:dit ing

Add BExcl.hhk to ExcludedHhks

Run this script:

Assign a bogus URI to each leaf.

Milestone 1:
