There are currently 5 directories you can build from, each producing a
different version of LICCPA.CPL:

o  root (...\net\ui\liccpa)
   Builds the version of LICCPA.CPL that ships in the base NT Server OS.

o  nfr-bo3
   Builds a limited Not For Resale version for BackOffice.  Services are
   always configuired in per server mode for 3 simultaneous connections.

o  nfr-bo5
   Builds a limited Not For Resale version for BackOffice.  Services are
   always configuired in per server mode for 5 simultaneous connections.

o  nfr-nt10
   Builds a limited Not For Resale version, distributed in a special NFR
   version of NT Server.  Services are always configuired in per server
   mode for 10 simultaneous connections.

o  msdn
   Builds a limited version for the MSDN BackOfice test platform.
   Services are always configuired in per server mode for 5 simultaneous
   connections.

Marketing forces being what they are, I'm sure more versions will appear.

Note that these special versions of LICCPA.CPL should be accompanied by
a similarly special version of LLSSRV.EXE (built from
\nt\private\net\svcdlls\lls\server).
