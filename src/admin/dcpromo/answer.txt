ReplicaOrNewDomain=Replica



; NewDomain
;
; Used to indicate the type of the new domain, whether it will be a new
; domain in a new forest, the root of a new tree in an existing forest, or a
; child of an existing domain.
;
; Possible values:
;
; "Tree" - the new domain will be the root of a new tree in an existing
; forest.

NewDomain=Forest



; ReplicaDomainDNSName
; Used for BDC upgrades and new replica dc installs.  Value is the DNS
; domain name of the domain to be replicated from.  It is assumed that the
; currently logged-on user has administrative privileges to that domain,
; and that DNS services are properly configured.
;
; The domain name must refer to an existing DS domain.
;
; Ignored if ReplicationSourcePath refers to a valid set of restored backup
; files (as the domain name to which those files belong takes precedence)
;
; Default: none.  This value must be specified.

ReplicaDomainDNSName=spruce.ntdev.microsoft.com



; ParentDomainDNSName
; Used when child domain install is indicated.  Value is the DNS domain name
; of an existing DS domain.  It is assumed that the currently logged-on
; user has administrative privileges to this domain, and that DNS services
; are properly configured.
;
; Default: none.  This value must be specified.

ParentDomainDNSName=spruce.ntdev.microsoft.com



; ChildName
; Used when child domain install is indicated.  Value is the DNS label to be
; prepended to the value specified by ParentDomainDNSName to form a new
; domain name contiguous with and subordinate to the parent.  E.g. if the
; parent name is "spruce.ntdev.microsoft.com" and ChildName is "blue", then
; the name of the new domain is "blue.spruce.ntdev.microsoft.com".  This
; new domain name must not be in use and DNS services must be properly
; configured.
;
; Default: none.  This value must be specified.

ChildName=blue



; DomainNetbiosName
; Used to assign a flat name to the new domain.  The name must not already
; be in use as a domain or computer name.  This key is ignored when upgrading
; pre-Windows 2000 PDCs.
;
; Default: none.  This value must be specified.

DomainNetbiosName=blue-dom



; NewDomainDNSName
; Used when new tree in existing domain or new forest installation is
; indicated.  Value is the DNS domain name to be created.  This name may
; not be currently in use.
;
; Default: none.  This value must be specified.

NewDomainDNSName=aspen.ntdev.microsoft.com



; DNSOnNetwork
; Used in new forest installations when DNS client is not configured.
;
; Possbile values:
; "No" - "No, DNS is not on the network, install the DNS service, and
; create a zone for the new domain"
; "Yes" (or any other value) - "Yes, DNS is on the network, double-check
; that the local machine's DNS client configuration is complete."  (Note
; that if the local DNS client is not configured, the wizard will go into
; interactive mode.)
;
; Default: "Yes"

DNSOnNetwork=Yes



; DatabasePath
; Value must be the fully-qualified, non-unc path to a directory of a fixed
; disk of the local machine.  If the directory exists, it must be empty.
; If it does not, it will be created.  The volume must have sufficient disk
; space available -- at least 20MB for new domains.  For replicas, the
; space required is a function of domain size.  For optimal performance,
; the database path should be on a different volume than the log path.
;
; Default: %systemroot%\NTDS

DatabasePath=C:\ntds



; LogPath
; Value must be the fully-qualified, non-unc path to a directory of a fixed
; disk of the local machine.  If the directory exists, it must be empty.
; If it does not, it will be created.  The volume must have sufficient disk
; space available -- at least 10MB for new domains.  For replicas, the
; space required is a function of domain size.  For optimal performance,
; the database path should be on a different volume than the log path.
;
; Default: %systemroot%\NTDS
 
LogPath=C:\NTDS



; SYSVOLPath
; Value must be the fully-qualified, non-unc path to a directory of a fixed
; disk of the local machine.  If the directory exists, it must be empty.
; If it does not, it will be created.  The volume must be formatted with
; NTFS version 5.0.
;
; Default: %systemroot%\SYSVOL

SYSVOLPath=d:\sysvol



; SiteName (optional)
; Value is the name of an existing site in which to place the new DC.  If
; not specified, a suitable site will be selected.
;
; Default: "Default-First-Site"

SiteName=My-Answer-File-Site



; IsLastDCInDomain
; Only used for demote.  Value indicates that the machine is the last DC
; in the domain.
;
; "Yes" - DC is to be treated as the last in the domain.
; "No" - (or any other value) - DC is not the last in the domain.
;
; Default: No

IsLastDCInDomain=No



; AdministratorPassword
; Used when demoting a domain controller, to establish the local
; Administrator account password.
;
; Default: no password

AdministratorPassword=foo



; RebootOnSuccess
; Used to indicate whether the machine should be rebooted upon successful
; operation, or not.  The server must be rebooted for the directory
; service to be started.
;
; "Yes" - reboot the machine
; "NoAndNoPromptEither" - do not reboot the machine, and don't show the prompt
; to reboot either.  Just silently exit.
; "No" - (or any other value) do not reboot the machine.
;
; Default: "No"

RebootOnSuccess=No



; UserName
; Used to indicate the account credentials to be used for the promotion
; operation.
;
; Default: none.

UserName=Administrator



; Password
; Used to indicate the account credentials to be used for the promotion
; operation.
;
; Default: none.

Password=bar



; UserDomain
; Used to indicate the domain that the UserName should be taken from.
;
; Default: If the operation is to create a new forest or to become a member
; server from a BDC upgrade, there is no default.  If the operation is to
; create a new tree, then the default is the DNS name of the forest the
; computer is presently joined to.  If the operation is to create a new child
; domain or a replica, then the default is the DNS name of the domain the
; computer is joined to.  If the operation is to demote the computer, and the
; computer is a DC for a child domain, then the default is the DNS name of
; the parent domain.  If the operation is to demote the computer, and the
; computer is a DC of a tree root domain, then the default is the DNS name of
; the forest.

UserDomain=myDomain



; AutoConfigDNS
; Used to indicate whether the wizard should install and configure DNS for
; the new domain, as it has detected that dynamic dns updates are not
; available.
;
; If the wizard can't verify that dynamic DNS registration will be
; successful, and the value of this key is "Yes", then the wizard will
; install and configure DNS on the local computer.
;
; Otherwise, dynamic DNS is available, or the value is not "Yes", and so
; DNS will not be installed.
;
; Default: "Yes"

AutoConfigDNS=Yes



; AllowAnonymousAccess
; Used when downlevel (pre Windows 2000) servers will be authenticating users
; from this domain or any trusting domain.  This option indicates whether
; dcpromo should cause the permissions to be set to permit anonymous access
; to user and group information.
;
; "Yes" - downlevel servers will be used with this domain.  Allow anonymous
; access.
; "No" (or any other value) - all servers in the domain are Windows 2000 --
; use more restrictive, permissions.
;
; Default: "Yes"



; ReplicationSourceDC (optional)
; Used to indicate the name of the domain controller from which the domain
; information is to be replicated.  Only applies in new replica or BDC
; upgrade cases.  If no value is supplied, the closest domain controller
; for the domain being replicated will be selected.
;
; Default: (no value) - select a dc automatically

ReplicationSourceDC=



; SafeModeAdminPassword
; Used to supply the password to be set on the administrator account used
; when the computer is started in safe mode (or a variant of safe mode, like
; ds repair mode)
;
; Default: (no value) - blank password

SafeModeAdminPassword=MyHappyPassword



; CriticalReplicationOnly
; Used to specify that the promotion operation should perform only critical
; replication, then continue, skipping the (possibly very lengthy) non-
; critical portion.  Set to "yes" to skip non-critical replication.
;
; (in the case that non-critical replication is skipped, that replication
; will automatically and silently resume when the computer is rebooted and
; assumes its new role as a domain controller.)
;
; Default: (no value) - no; i.e. do critical and non-critical replication

CriticalReplicationOnly=yes



; ReplicationSourcePath
;
; Used to indicate that the bulk of the directory data replication should
; be drawn from backup files that have been restored to a volume on the
; server, rather from another domain controller.
;
; However, complete replication can not be performed entirely from copied
; files: access to another domain controller is still required.  (see
; ReplicationSourceDC)
;
; Indicates the location of the files to be used to create a new replica
; domain controller.  The value must be the fully-qualified path to a
; folder on the local computer where the files have been copied.
;
; If this value is present and non-empty, then data replication will be
; performed using the restored files.  If this value is not present or is
; empty, then replication will take place entirely over the wire.
;
; If the value refers to a valid set of restored backup files, then any
; value for the ReplicaDomainDNSName key will be ignored, as the domain
; name to which the restored files belong takes precedence.
;
; Default: none
;
; Example: "C:\restored\ds"

ReplicationSourcePath=



; ConfirmGc
;
; Only applies if ReplicationSourcePath is specified.  If restored files
; were created from a backup of a global catalog, then the replica can also
; be made a global catalog from those files.  Use this value to indicate
; whether the replica should also be a global catalog, or not.
;
; If this value is "Yes" and the backup was of a global catalog, then the
; replica will also be made a global catalog.  Otherwise, the replica will
; not be made a global catalog
;
; Default: "Yes"
							 
ConfirmGc=No



; Syskey
;
; Only applies if ReplicationSourcePath is specified.  This value is used
; if the restored files used to install a replica indicate that the system
; key must be supplied by the user.
;
; If the restored files indicate that the system key must be supplied on
; diskette, then the system will look for the key on drive A:
;
; Default: none

Syskey=



; SetForestVersion
;
; Only applies if the machine is a NT4 domain controller completing upgrade,
; and the domain controller will be the first dc in a new forest
; (NewDomain=Forest).  This key will indicate whether or not to set the new
; forest behavior version level to 1.  Level 1 allows more efficient
; replication of large group memberships, but will prevent any Windows 2000
; domain controllers from being added to the forest.
;
; If the value is "Yes", the level will be set to 1.  If not, the level will
; not be set.
;
; Default: "No"

SetForestVersion=No
