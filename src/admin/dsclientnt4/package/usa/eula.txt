IMPORTANT:  READ CAREFULLY – The Microsoft operating system components accompanying this Supplemental EULA, including any "online" or electronic documentation ("OS Components") are subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement under which you have licensed the applicable Microsoft operating system product described below (each an "End User License Agreement" or "EULA") and the terms and conditions of this Supplemental EULA.  BY INSTALLING, COPYING, DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE OS COMPONENTS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE APPLICABLE OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCT EULA AND THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL, COPY, DOWNLOAD, ACCESS, OR USE THE OS COMPONENTS.

NOTE:  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALIDLY LICENSED COPY OF ANY VERSION OR EDITION OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT 4.0 (each an "OS Product"), YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INSTALL, COPY, DOWNLOAD, ACCESS, OR OTHERWISE USE THE OS COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.

Capitalized terms used in this Supplemental EULA and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the applicable OS Product EULA.

General.  The OS Components are provided to you solely to update, supplement, or replace existing functionality of the applicable OS Product, and upon installation the OS Components become a part of the OS Product.  In the event your OS Product is a version of Windows NT Server, the OS Components are deemed "Client Software".  You are hereby granted a license to use the OS Components under the terms and conditions of the OS Product EULA for the applicable OS Product (which are hereby incorporated by reference) and the terms and conditions set forth in this Supplemental EULA, provided that you comply with all such terms and conditions.  To the extent that there is a conflict among any of these terms and conditions applicable to the OS Components, the terms and conditions in this Supplemental EULA shall take precedence.

Additional Rights and Limitations.  

*	You may reproduce, install and use one copy of the OS Components on each of your computers running validly licensed copies of the OS Product provided that each such computer is not acting as a domain controller, and provided that you use such additional copies of the OS Components in accordance with the terms and conditions above.  

*	Unless you acquired the OS Components on external media, you may make a single copy of the OS Components solely for archival purposes or reinstallation of the OS Components on the same computer as the OS Components were previously installed.  Microsoft Corporation, its subsidiaries and/or suppliers retain all right, title and interest in and to the OS Components.  All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft Corporation, its subsidiaries and/or suppliers.

*	You may reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the OS Components (either (i) as a whole, including all components, (ii) as a whole but without the user interface components, or (iii) just the complete Active Directory Service Interfaces ("ADSI") package portion) provided that: (a) you distribute the OS Components in object code form only as part of and in conjunction with your own software application product; (b) your software application product adds significant and primary functionality to the OS Components; (c) you distribute your own software application product containing the OS Components pursuant to an End-User License Agreement with terms no less protective than those contained in the applicable OS Product EULA (including the restrictions contained in this Supplemental EULA).  Your End-User License Agreement may be "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed; (d) you include a valid copyright notice for your software application product and do not remove any copyright or trademark notices contained in the OS Components; (e) you indemnify, hold harmless and defend Microsoft from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys' fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of your software application product; (f) you do not modify the OS Components; and (g) you do not permit further redistribution of the OS Components.

*	You acknowledge that the OS Components are of U.S. origin.
