Local Security Snapin Install Notes:
====================================

Start a command window.

Change directories to the directory where you copied all of the .dll files.

Type 'install' at the command prompt.  If the result is a message
"Installation successful," you win.  Now go and run MMC.  The Microsoft
Local Security Snapin should appear in the list of loadable snapins.

If you see the message "Installation failed," you lose.  Call/email sburns
for your consolation prize.
