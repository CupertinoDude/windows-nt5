How to add a new option to the buggy.sys test driver
=====================================================================

Buggy is organized assuming that what you want to do is to send an
IOCTL to the driver to perform some kernel mode testing activity.
If all that has to be done can be triggered with a function call
then the rest of the integration can be done pretty easy by a few
declarations in some headers.

You need to do the following things to add a new action:

- write your stuff in a new module and describe exports in a
  header. The general structure should be similar with the one
  in driver\newstuff.c and driver\newstuff.h.
- connect your code with the driver logic by modifying driver\funs.h
  header. If you search for the word `newstuff' you will find all the 
  places where you have to change something. 
- modify driver\active.h header so that you can offer the option of
  disabling your code from the driver. This is needed so that the 
  driver will not get fat with code that is not always needed.
  
Enjoy.
