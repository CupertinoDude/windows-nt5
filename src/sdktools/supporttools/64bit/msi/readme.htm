<H2><A name=about>About the Tools</A></H2>
<P>The Windows Support Tools for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Professional and 
Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition are intended for use by Microsoft support 
personnel and experienced users to assist in diagnosing and resolving computer 
problems. For individual tool descriptions, see the Windows Support Tools online 
tool documentation (Suptools.chm).</P>
<HR>

<H2><A name=setup>Setup for Support Tools Software</A></H2>
<P>The Windows Support Tools for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Professional and 
Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition are located in the \Support\Tools folder on the 
Windows&nbsp;XP Professional and Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition CDs, 
respectively. The \Support\Tools folder contains a Windows Installer file 
(suptools.msi), which installs the Support Tools utilities and tools on your 
computer's hard drive.</P>
<P class=indent><B>Note</B><BR>The Application Compatibility Toolkit does not 
install with the Support Tools.</P>
<P class=indent><B>Important</B><BR>These tools have not been localized: they 
are written and tested in English only. Using these tools with a different 
language version of Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Professional or Windows&nbsp;XP 
64-Bit Edition might produce unpredictable results.</P>

<H2><A name=toolsnotinst>Tools Documented But Not Installed In This Release</A></H2>
<P>The following tools are documented in the Support Tools help file (Suptools.chm) but are not installed in this release.</P>

prompt for syntax help.</P>

<H2><A name=general>General Setup Instructions</A></H2>
<P>The Windows Support Tools for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Professional and 
Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition can be installed only on a computer running the 
Windows&nbsp;XP Professional or Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition operating system. 
They cannot be used to upgrade Microsoft® Windows&nbsp;NT® or Windows®&nbsp;2000 
Support Tools installed on Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT or Windows&nbsp;2000, 
respectively.</P>
<P class=proclabel>To install the Windows&nbsp;XP Professional and 
Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition Support Tools</P>
<P class=indent><B>Important</B><BR>It is highly recommended that you remove all 
previous versions of Support Tools, including beta versions of the Windows 
Support Tools for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Professional and Windows&nbsp;XP 
64-Bit Edition, before running the Support Tools installation program.<BR><BR>If 
the Setup program finds an older version of Support Tools, it opens a dialog box 
with <B>Add/Remove</B> and <B>Remove all</B> (default) options. If you select 
<B>Remove all</B>, Setup automatically uninstalls Support Tools. If you select 
<B>Add/Remove</B>, you can manually uninstall Support Tools.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Start Windows&nbsp;XP Professional or Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition, and 
  then insert the Windows&nbsp;XP Professional or Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition 
  CD in your CD-ROM drive. 
  <LI>Follow the instructions that appear on your screen. </LI></OL>
<P class=indent><B>Note</B><BR>In the unlikely event that your computer pauses 
for a few minutes during installation while the Setup window is displaying 
"publishing product information," please be patient. The Setup program will 
continue shortly and will finish installing the Support Tools.</P>
<P>The Setup program installs Windows Support Tools files onto your hard disk. A 
typical installation requires 4 megabytes (MB) of free space.</P>
<P>As it installs the Support Tools, Setup:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Creates a <B>Windows Support Tools</B> folder within the <B>Program 
  Files</B> folder on the <B>Start</B> menu, which contains a shortcut to the 
  Windows Support Tools Help. From there you can access the online documentation 
  and launch tools. 
  <LI>Adds the \Program Files\Support Tools directory (or the directory name you 
  choose for installing the tools) to your computer's hard drive. 
  <LI>Appends the \Program Files\Support Tools directory to your computer's PATH 
  statement. This enables you to run an installed Support Tool from a command 
  prompt within any folder on the hard drive without specifying the path to the 
  Support Tools folder. </LI></UL>
<P>Some tools require separate or additional setup besides the steps described 
earlier. For more information about each of these tools and others with 
additional requirements, as well as a complete list of the tools, see the online 
Help file (Suptools.chm).</P>
<P class=indent><B>Note</B><BR>  On the Windows&nbsp;XP 
Professional and Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition CDs, most tools are compressed 
into cabinet (.cab) files. You cannot run executable files, call other binaries, 
or open documentation directly from .cab files. Before you run a tool that you 
have not installed by using the Support Tools Setup, you must first extract all 
executable files and dependencies for a tool from the .cab file on the CD to 
your hard drive.<BR><BR>Be aware also that for some tools, the Support Tools 
Setup or the tool's own Setup program performs other installation procedures, 
such as making changes in the registry. You might not be able to run these tools 
even if you extract all their files from the .cab; first install them with the 
Support Tools Setup or the tool's own Setup program.</P>
<H3><A name=instal>Installing from the Command Prompt</A></H3>
<P>You can install the Windows Support Tools for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP 
Professional and Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition from the command prompt. If 
necessary, you can also use the <B>/qb</B> option to install or uninstall in 
silent mode, which requires no further interaction from the user. </P>
<P>The following table lists the command-line options for installing from the 
command prompt.</P>

  is not affected by the bandwidth consumed. Requests are placed in a queue 
  until the files are transferred, at which time the requesting application is 
  invoked and notified of the completion.</P>
