         Microsoft(R) Windows XP Multilingual User Interface Pack

                         August 2001
**********************************************************************
Welcome to the release notes for Microsoft Windows Multilingual User 
Interface Pack (MUI). This document provides late-breaking or other 
information that supplements the Windows XP documentation. There are 
several release notes files on the MUI compact disc:

  *  Readme.txt (important pre-installation information)
  *  RelNotes.txt (this file, compatibility and post-installation notes)

Setting the "Language for non-Unicode programs"
--------------------------------------------------
If you will be running non-Unicode programs on the MUI system,
you should set the "Language for non-Unicode programs" to match the 
language of the non-Unicode programs. Since this is a system wide setting, 
only one language is supported concurrently on the system. 

This setting is not required for Unicode programs, but setting it to match the 
language of the running programs may still improve application 
compatibility. 

You can change the "Language for non-Unicode programs" setting in 
Regional and Language Options in the Control Panel. 


Not all UI strings are localized
--------------------------------
Some UI strings remain in English even if the user's UI is set to another 
language. This is because certain strings in some component areas do not 
work with MUI yet (i.e. remain in English) due to the complexity of the 
technologies(The main areas include: all 16-bit programs, registry keys 
and values, and strings in INF files.) This affects about 3% of the User 
Interface - most of the areas affect administrative tools. Localized systems 
have all these strings translated. 

Fonts used in the UI look bad
----------------------------
You may notice that the User Interface text for certain languages displays 
poorly on machines on which multiple UI languages are in use. This is most 
visible when the "Language for non-Unicode programs" is set to Chinese and 
the current user's UI language is Japanese. The solution is to switch the 
"Language for non-Unicode programs" to match the UI language. If you have 
users of all 4 East-Asian UI languages working on the same machine, we 
recommend you initially set the "Language for non-Unicode programs" to 
Japanese and then change back to US English or keep it as Japanese. 

Outlook Express
---------------
The User Interface language of Outlook Express will change only when 
the "Language for non-Unicode programs" matches the user interface language. 

The folders created in Outlook Express will not switch language. 
We therefore recommend that Outlook Express be setup after the preferred 
UI language has been set.

Recommendations for using MUI OS and localized OS versions together
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Use English Computer names on localized versions of 
Windows XP/Windows 2000
    
Reason: DS & Group policy will fail if localized machine names are 
used in a multilingual environment.

2. As a precaution, do the following:

	3.1 logon locally to the DC as Administrator 
	3.2 run dsa.msc
	3.3 Right click on the domain node, choose Properties
	3.4 Click on Group Policy Tab, select "the Default Domain Group Policy"
	4.4 Disable the following policy (i.e., set State=Disable):

User Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Group Policy\Disable 
Automatic Update of ADM files

For detailed information, please see KB article: Q286012

3. Synchronize the time of the client machine with the DC's time. 

Note: If you do this manually, please check the time zone! (We recommend the 
"net time /DOMAIN:domainname /set" command)

Reason: Machine Policy may fail if time is skewed. 
 
4. We do not recommend using folder redirection or logon to the localized 
OSs as a roaming user. 

If you need to roam or use folder redirection policy, be aware that multiple 
language versions of My Documents and other per-user folders could be 
created on the machine. You will also have to manually add other language 
support (such as East Asian) to the system in order for these localized
folder names to be displayed properly. If you use the same UI language 
across different MUI machines, this should not be an issue. 


Using DCPromo and other server tools
------------------------------------
When running DCPromo, or installing server applications, we recommend 
you set both the default and the interactive user UI language to English. 

For example, if you set the default user's UI language to one of the 
European languages and run DCPromo, the well-known security principals 
(mostly under the Built-in container in AD Users & Computers) are 
created using the localized names from this language. This will 
cause trouble for some users that do not understand the language. 
Keeping the UI in English will leave these names in English. 


Improving localized application compatibility
-------------------------------------------
The MUISetup program contains three settings to help configure
an MUI system to most closely match a localized OS. If you want an MUI 
system to provide maximum application compatibility for a single 
language, you can set all these three settings to the same language. 
However, you should be aware of the side-effects of applying these 
settings when evaluating whether or not to use them. 


1. Language for default user and new user account: 

This setting specifies the User Interface language for the default user 
account as well as any new user accounts created afterwards. This 
setting affects the logon screen UI language and other 
services running on the machine. Setting this language to match 
the application's language sometimes can improve some localized 
applications' compatibility. Each machine can only have one such 
setting. You can also set the default user's UI language from the 
Advanced tab in Regional and Language Options in Control Panel. 

2. Match the "Language for non-Unicode programs" to the default user language

This setting will force the "Language for non-Unicode programs" to 
be the same as the default user's UI language. Select this check box 
if you want to run non-Unicode programs in the specified language. This 
setting affects all users of the computer and only one language 
can be set on a machine. Setting the language for non-Unicode 
programs can improve application compatibility for some Unicode 
applications as well. You can also set the language for non-Unicode 
programs from the Advanced tab in Regional and Language Options 
in Control Panel. 

3. Set Shell UI font to match the default user's UI language 

Specifies whether you want the display fonts used on the desktop 
to match the default user's UI language. This setting is only 
available when the previous two settings are set. At this release, 
this setting only affects Japanese. Specifying this setting can cause 
other UI languages to display poorly. Clear this checkbox if anyone 
working on this computer uses a language other than Japanese. Setting 
this option will improve the application compatibility for some localized 
programs. This setting can only be changed within MUIsetup. 

Components that do not switch User Interface language
-----------------------------------------------------------
The following components do not switch User Interface language: 
  MSN Explorer
  NetMeeting
  Portions of Internet Connection Wizard
  HyperTerminal 
  (not all components listed here)


MSN Explorer
------------
MSN Explorer will remain in English when the UI language is changed in MUI. 
You can remove the current version of MSN Explorer in the Control Panel 
under "Add or Remove Programs" and then install MSN Explorer for another 
country/region from http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.


Other minor issues
------------------
1.  MMC: When saving an MMC console file, please use Latin characters only. 
    Using characters outside the system code page will cause the help file 
    not to display. 

2.  Uninstalling MUI:  If you decide to uninstall a UI language in use by the 
    current user, you must reboot the system to ensure the language is 
    completely removed or set the UI language back to English first 
    and then uninstall the UI language. 

3.  Movie Maker: If the current user’s??? user name includes characters outside 
    the system code page, Movie Maker will display an error message saying 
    the archived collection file is corrupted. You must set the "Language
    for non-Unicode program" to match the language that supports the 
    characters to resolve this problem.

4.  Simplified Chinese UI: The original WangMa IME 98 cannot be installed on
    Simplified Chinese UI. Please contact the software vendor to get an updated 
    Version. 

5.  Start menu items: If you upgrade from Windows 2000 to XP, you will have some 
    items under Start menu that do not switch language. To fix this, you must 
    set all the program folders under your personal document folder to READONLY. 
    You can try the following commands to fix them:

      Start a Command Prompt from Start | Accessory or just type CMD.EXE 
      in Start | Run window. The Command Prompt should start under your 
      user¡¯s document folder, such as C:\Documents and Settings\UserMe
      Type the following commands in Command Prompt:
           CD "Start Menu"
           CD "Programs" 
           Attrib /s +r . 
	(you need to apply this for all the folders under "Programs"). 

6.  Windows Media Player tour: when starting the tour from Windows Tour or directly
    from Start | Run program, the tour will start in English mode. Please use 
    the following method to start the localized language version: 
 
        Click Start
        Click Run 
        Input %windir%\help\tours\WindowsMediaPlayer\MUI\<LangID>\wmptour.hta 
          in the editing field and click OK to start the Tour. The <LangID> 
          must be replaced with a meaningful 4 digit number corresponding to 
          each language listed below,  such as input  
          %windir%\help\tours\WindowsMediaPlayer\MUI\0411\wmptour.hta 
          to start the Tour in Japanese: 

	0401 Arabic
	0405 Czech
	0406 Danish
	0413 Dutch (Standard)
	0409 English (United States)
	040b Finnish
	040c French (Standard)
	0407 German
	0408 Greek
	040d Hebrew
	040e Hungarian
	0410 Italian
	0411 Japanese
	0412 Korean
	0414 Norwegian
	0415 Polish
	0416 Portuguese (Brazil)
	0816 Portuguese (Standard)
	0419 Russian
	0804 Simplified Chinese
	0c0a Spanish (Modern Sort)
	041b Slovak
	0424 Slovenian 
	041d Swedish
	0404 Traditional Chinese
	041f Turkish

7.  Console programs: you may sometimes see strange strings (such as "???") from console 
    programs. We recommend you to set the "Language for non-Unicode programs" 
    to match the User Interface language (also called "menu and dialog language") 
    to work around this problem. 

8.  Help content displayed by the non-HTML Help system (or Winhlp32.exe): When 
    "Language for non-Unicode programs" does not match the User Interface language, 
    you may see following two issues with content displayed by the old Windows 
    help system:
     a. The word wrapping for long strings from context sensitive help in dialogs 
        may not match the quality you see on localized OSs for some of the languages. 
        This should not prevent you from reading the dialog. 
     b. The title on help window may be unreadable. 

9.  Help from HTML Help: if the user name includes characters that are not supported 
    by both the ¡°Language for non-Unicode programs¡± and language of the ¡°Standards and 
    formats¡±, you may not be able to open some of the help contents. The work around 
    is either use Latin characters for the user name or set both settings to a language that 
    supports the characters used in the user name (such as setting them as Japanese if 
    you have Japanese characters in the user name).

10. Help for optional components: to get localized help content for these components, you 
    either need to add the component before adding MUI or re-install MUI afterwards. 

11. IA64: Please do not uninstall East Asian language support after you have added it. 
    Doing so will render any IME unusable after you add it back. If you have encountered this issue 
    already, please use REGEDIT to remove following entries:
       HKLM\system\currentcontrolset\control\nls\language group\7,8.9.

12. Narrator supports English only: Due to technological limitations, the Narrator 
    text-to-speech engine only works with English strings and the English User Interface.
