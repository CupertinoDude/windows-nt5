1.   NEW FEATURES
-----------------

Like earlier versions of Exception Monitor, EM 8.0 allows you to monitor and view system information to diagnose an exception or fault. Unlike earlier versions, you don't need to be an expert with debugging commands to obtain useful information. EM 8.0 puts a user-friendly shell around the debugging environment, allowing users to perform an automatic monitoring session by selecting from a standard debug script (.ecx files). 

If you are comfortable with debugging commands, you can access the CDB window by performing a manual monitoring session. The CDB window allows experienced users to interact with and control the debugger using commands.

-------------------------------
2.   CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------

Operating Systems compatible with EM 8.0:

Windows 2000 or later

You also will need Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater to operate the Help file properly.

Note:   Users of earlier operating systems must use Exception Monitor 7.0 or earlier.
