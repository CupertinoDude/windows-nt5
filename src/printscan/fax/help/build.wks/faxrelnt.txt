----------------------------------------------------------
1. Monitoring Fax Transmissions and Answering Calls Manually
----------------------------------------------------------

This release of Microsoft Personal Fax for Windows includes 
Fax Monitor and an option to answer calls manually. You can 
use Fax Monitor to see the current status of Personal Fax, to 
interrupt calls, and to turn off manual answering for the next 
call. The options for Fax Monitor are controlled on the Monitor tab 
in the Fax Properties dialog box, where you can set options to 
do the following.

	* 	Use an icon on the taskbar to display Fax Monitor or 
  		its options
	* 	Display Fax Monitor automatically when you send or 
  		receive a fax
	* 	Display Fax Monitor on top of all other windows
	* 	Play a sound when you receive a fax
	* 	Turn on Manual Answer

>>>	To change settings for Fax Monitor
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then 
		double-click Fax.
      	2. 	Click the Monitor tab.
      	3. 	Select the options you want.

If your phone line is used for both fax and voice calls, enabling 
Manual Answer lets you choose to answer calls manually. If you 
receive a phone call while this feature is turned on, Personal Fax 
prompts you to answer the call. After you answer and find that the 
call is a fax call, you can click Yes to receive the fax.

>>>	To turn on Manual Answer
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then 
		double-click Fax.
      	2. 	Click the Monitor tab.
      	3. 	Select the Enable Manual Answer check box.

When you know in advance that the next call will be a fax call,
you can set Personal Fax to ignore Manual Answer for that call only.

>>>	To turn off Manual Answer for the next call
      	1. 	On the taskbar, click the Fax icon.
      	2. 	In Fax Monitor, select the Answer Next Call check box.


----------------------------------------------------------
2. Setting the Number of Rings Before Answering
----------------------------------------------------------

With this release, you can now specify how many rings you 
want before Personal Fax answers a call.

>>>	To set the number of rings before answering
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then 
		double-click Fax.
      	2. 	Click the Receive tab.
      	3. 	In Rings Before Answer, type the number of rings you want.

Note: When the Manual Answer check box is selected on the 
Monitor tab in the Fax Properties dialog box, the number of rings 
is automatically set to 99.


----------------------------------------------------------
3. Using the Same Modem for a Remote Access Server and 
for Faxing
----------------------------------------------------------

You can use the same modem for both a Remote Access 
Server (RAS) and for fax transmissions as long as the modem 
supports a feature called "adaptive answer." If your modem 
doesn't support adaptive answer, you can still use the same 
modem for outgoing RAS and fax transmissions. You won't, 
however, be able to receive both faxes and dial-in RAS calls. 
To receive dial-in RAS calls on a non-adaptive-answer modem, 
you need to disable your modem for fax receipt.

>>>	To disable your modem for fax receipt
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then 
		double-click Fax.
      	2. 	Click the Receive tab.
      	3. 	Under Device Name, click to clear the check box next to 
		the name of your modem.


----------------------------------------------------------
4. If You've Changed Your Fax Administrator Account Password
----------------------------------------------------------

If you've changed the password for your Fax Administrator 
account (the account specified during Setup), you will also need 
to change the password for your Fax Service so that the two 
passwords match.

>>>	To change your Fax Service password
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then 
		double-click Services.
      	2. 	Under Services, click Microsoft Fax Service, and then click 
		the Startup button.
      	3. 	Under Log On As, type the new password in the Password box.
      	4. 	Type the new password again in the Confirm Password box.
      	5. 	Click OK in each dialog box.


----------------------------------------------------------
5. Turning Off Print Spooler Event Logging for Fax Events
----------------------------------------------------------

If you prefer not to log print spooler fax events, you can turn off 
this option by disabling print system event logging. Please note that 
doing so will also disable all events logged by the print spooler.

>>>	To disable print system event logging
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
      	2. 	On the File menu, click Server Properties.
      	3. 	Click the Advanced tab.
      	4. 	Click to clear the check box next to Log spooler 
		information events.


----------------------------------------------------------
6. If You Receive a "Could Not Process All Attachments" Message
----------------------------------------------------------

This message appears after sending a fax from Windows 
Messaging when you've attached a file from a program that 
doesn't support file attachments.

To fax a file from a program that doesn't support file 
attachments when faxing from Windows Messaging, send the 
file from the program directly.

>>>	To fax a file from a program
      	1. 	In the program, select your fax printer as the target
		printer.
      	2. 	On the File menu, click Print or Send.
      	3. 	Follow the instructions in the Fax Send Utility.


----------------------------------------------------------
7. If You Can't Send a Fax After Replacing or Reinstalling Your Modem
----------------------------------------------------------

If you have problems faxing after replacing or reinstalling your 
modem, restart Windows NT 4.0. If that doesn't clear up the 
problem, reinstall Personal Fax for Windows.


----------------------------------------------------------
8. If Windows Messaging Stops Responding After You've Installed 
Personal Fax for Windows
----------------------------------------------------------

If, after installing Personal Fax, Windows Messaging does 
nothing when you try to open it, restart Windows NT 4.0, and then, 
do the following.

      	1. 	Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then 
		double-click Mail.
      	2. 	Click Show Profiles.
      	3. 	Click the profile that you specified during fax Setup, and 
		then click Properties.
      	4. 	Select Fax Mail Transport, and then click Remove.

You will be able to open Windows Messaging, but you won't 
be able to send faxes from it. Instead, you can  send faxes by 
using the Send Fax Utility or by faxing documents directly from 
their programs.


----------------------------------------------------------
9. If You Don't Receive an Expected Fax
----------------------------------------------------------

There are two possible reasons you may not receive an 
expected fax.

	1.   	The destination printer, folder, or inbox specified on the 
		Receive tab in the Fax Properties dialog box is unavailable.
		This generates the NT Fax event "The device is not ready."

		To receive the fax, make the destination available, and
		the fax normally will be delivered after 10 or 20 minutes.

		If the destination cannot be made available, specify a
		different destination on the Receive tab in the Fax Properties
		dialog box, cancel the document in the printer queue, and
		have the fax resent.

	2.   	The drive where your Windows NT system files reside is at 
		or near capacity. The Fax Service will attempt to answer an 
		incoming fax, but will immediately stop. The fax won't be
		received and no event will be generated.

		To resume receiving faxes, delete some files to free up space,
		and then have the fax resent.


----------------------------------------------------------
10. If the Paste Command Is Unavailable in Cover Page Editor
----------------------------------------------------------

Cover Page Editor allows one Note field for each cover page. 
If you try to copy and paste a second Note field into a cover 
page, the Paste command will be unavailable. To paste a Note 
field into a cover page, select the one already in the cover page, 
and then delete it. The Paste command will become available.


----------------------------------------------------------
11. If You Don't Receive Fax Status E-mail when Using the Send Fax Utility or 
Faxing from a Program
----------------------------------------------------------

For this release, fax status e-mail is sent only when you send a 
fax by using Windows Messaging. To view the progress of a fax 
transmission or to learn the status of recent fax transmissions, 
you can use Fax Monitor (see release note 1). To find out if 
you've received a fax, you can also check the destination you 
set up for receiving faxes, such as a certain folder or printer.

For complete information about fax events, you can use the 
Windows NT Event Viewer.

>>>	To view details of fax events in Event Viewer
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative 
		Tools (Common), and then click Event Viewer.
      	2. 	On the Log menu, click Application.
      	3. 	Under Source, look for NT Fax events.
      	4. 	Double-click an event to see a complete description.


----------------------------------------------------------
12. To Report Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------

You can report bugs by filling out the Problem Reporting Form 
included in this release.

>>>	To use the Problem Reporting Form
      	1. 	Click Start, point to Programs, point to Fax (Common), 
		and then click Problem Reporting Form.
      	2. 	Fill out the form, and then e-mail it to ntbug@microsoft.com
