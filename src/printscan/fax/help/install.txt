H. NOTES

H.1 Right now we reference fax.hlp in the NT Windows.Cnt by adding an ":Index Fax0.Hlp" (changed from Fax.hlp in 3/28/97 version of install instructions). This file has a topic which creates entries for "fax procedures" in the Windows.Hlp index users open on the start menu. If installing (Personal, Client/Server) fax becomes standard in any release of Windows NT, then this should be added to the Windows.Cnt file, and steps for inserting it here should be removed.
