#
# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.
#
MAJORCOMP=awd2tiff
MINORCOMP=w95fdump
#
# The developer defines the TARGETNAME variable. It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.
# It should not include any path or filename extension.
#
TARGETNAME=faxdump
#
# The developer defines the TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables.

# The first variable specifies where the target will be built. The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM). Use UMAPPL_NOLIB when you are only building user-mode
# programs and do not need to build a library.
#
TARGETPATH=obj
# Select one of the following, and delete the others:
TARGETTYPE=PROGRAM
#TARGETTYPE=DYNLINK
#TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY
#TARGETTYPE=UMAPPL_NOLIB
#TARGETTYPE=BOOTPGM
#
# The TARGETLIBS macro specifies additional libraries to link against your target

# image. Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine-specific subdirectory name should go.
#
TARGETLIBS=..\migrate\obj\*\migrate.lib

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory. Separate multiple paths with single
# semicolons. Relative path specifications are okay.
#
INCLUDES=..\inc
#
# The developer defines the SOURCES macro. It contains a list of all the
# source files for this component. Specify each source file on a separate

# line using the line-continuation character. This minimizes merge
# conflicts if two developers are adding source files to the same component.
#

SOURCES=w95fdump.c  

#SOURCES=source1.c  \
#        source2.c  \
#        source3.c  \
#        source4.c
#i386_SOURCES=i386\source1.asm
#ALPHA_SOURCES=alpha\source1.s
#MIPS_SOURCES=mips\source1.s
#PPC_SOURCES=ppc\source1.s


#
# Next, specify options for the compiler using C_DEFINES. 
#
#C_DEFINES=-DUNICODE -D_UNICODE
C_DEFINES=
#
# Next, specify one or more user-mode test programs and their type. 

# Use UMTEST for optional test programs. Use UMAPPL for
# programs that are always built when the directory is built. See also
# UMTYPE,  UMBASE,  and UMLIBS. 
#
UMTYPE=console
#UMTEST=bunny*baz
#UMAPPL=bunny*baz
#UMBASE=0x1000000
#UMLIBS=obj\*\bunny.lib
#
# Defining either (or both) the variables NTTARGETFILE0 and/or NTTARGETFILES
# causes makefile.def to include .\makefile.inc immediately after it

# specifies the top level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.
# The makefile.def file expands NTTARGETFILE0 as the first dependent for the
# "all" target and NTTARGETFILES as the last dependent for the "all" target.
# This is useful for specifying additional targets and dependencies that do not fit the
# general case covered by makefile.def.
#
#   NTTARGETFILE0=
#   NTTARGETFILES=
