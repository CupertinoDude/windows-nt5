----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Using the same modem for a Remote Access Server and Faxing
----------------------------------------------------------------
   You can use the same modem for both a Remote Access Server (RAS) and Fax
transmissions as long as the modem supports a feature called "Adaptive
Answer." If your modem doesn't support Adaptive Answer, you can still use the
same modem for dialing out both RAS and Fax transmissions. You won't, however,
be able to receive both faxes and dial-in RAS calls. To receive dial-in RAS
calls on a non-Adaptive Answer modem, disable Fax Receive.

>>>>> To disable Fax Receive:
      1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
      2. Double-click Fax.
      3. Click the Receive tab.
      4. In Device Name, click the box next to the name of your modem to
remove the check mark.
      5. Click OK.


-----------------------------------------------------
2. If You've Changed Your Fax Administrator Account Password
-----------------------------------------------------
   If you've changed the password for your Fax Administrator account (the
account specified during setup), you will also need to change the password
for your Fax Service to match.

>>>>> To change your Fax Service password:
      1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
      2. Double-click Services.
      3. Click Microsoft Fax Service, and then click the Startup button.
      4. In Log On As, type the new password in the Password box.
      5. Type the new password again in the Confirm Password box.
      6. Click OK in each dialog box.


---------------------------------------
3. To Disable Print Spooler Event Logging for Fax Events
---------------------------------------
   If you prefer not to log print spooler fax events, you can disable this
by disabling print system event logging.  Please note that this will also
disable all events logged by the print spooler.

>>>>> To disable print system event logging:
      1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
      2. On the File menu, click Server Properties.
      3. Click the Advanced tab.
      4. Click the box next to Log Spooler Information Events to remove the
check mark.
      5. Click OK.


-------------------------------------------------
4. "Could Not Process All Attachments" Error Message
-------------------------------------------------
   If you receive this message after sending a fax from Windows Messaging,
you've attached a file from an application that does not support this
function.
   To fax a file from an application that doesn't support file attachments
when faxing from Windows Messaging, send the file from the application
directly.

>>>>> To fax a file from an application:
      1. Within the application, select your fax printer as your target
printer.
      2. On the File menu, click Print or Send.
      3. Follow the instructions in the Send Fax Utility.


-----------------------------------------------------------
5. If You Can't Fax After Replacing or Reinstalling Your Modem
-----------------------------------------------------------

   If you have problems faxing after replacing or reinstalling your modem,
restart Windows NT 4.0. If that doesn't clear up the problem, reinstall
Microsoft Personal Fax for Windows.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. If Windows Messaging Stops Responding After You've Installed Microsoft
Personal Fax for Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   If, after installing Microsoft Personal Fax for Windows, Windows Messaging
does nothing when you try to open it, restart Windows NT 4.0. After this, open
Control Panel by clicking Start, pointing to Settings, and clicking Control
Panel. Double-click Mail, and click on Show Profiles.  Select the profile that
you specified during fax setup and click Properties.  Select Fax Mail Transport
and click Remove.  You will be able to open Windows Messaging, but you won't
be able to send faxes from it. To send faxes, use the Send Fax Utility or fax
documents directly from their applications.


------------------------------------
7. If You Don't Receive An Expected Fax
------------------------------------

There are two possible reasons you may not receive an expected fax.  In both
cases, you should correct the problem and then have the fax resent.

1.   Microsoft Personal Fax for Windows has a feature called "Persistent
Routing." This feature causes the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 computer to
persist in routing a received fax to its destination even if the destination
is not available when the fax arrives. For example, if you've set up received
faxes to print, but the server for the printer you selected is not
functioning, faxes will continue to be sent to the printer until it is
received by the spooler.
    Currently, this feature is not functional. It will be fully functional in
the next release.

2.   The drive where your Windows NT system files reside is at or near
capacity. The Fax Service will attempt to answer an incoming fax transmission,
but will immediately stop. The fax is not received and no event is generated.
    To resume receiving faxes, delete some files to free some space.


-------------------------------------------------
8. No "Paste" Command Available in Cover Page Editor
-------------------------------------------------

   The cover page editor allows you to have one Note field for each cover
page. If you try to copy and paste items, including a Note field, into a cover
page already containing a Note field, the Paste command will be unavailable.
to solve this, first select the Note field already in the cover page and
delete it. The Paste command will now be available.


--------------------------------------------------------------
9. No Fax Status Email for Send Fax Utility or Application Faxing
--------------------------------------------------------------

   For this technology preview release, a fax status email is sent only
when you fax using Windows Messaging. To learn the status of sent faxes
using the Fax Send Utility or when faxing from an application, you'll need
to monitor the fax printer. To find out if you've received a fax, you'll
need to monitor the destination you set up for receiving faxes, such as a
folder or printer.


--------------
10. To Report Bugs
--------------

   On your Fax Start menu, you'll find the Problem Reporting Form by clicking
Start and Selecting Programs and then Fax.  This is a form for you to fill
out and email to ntbug@microsoft.com
