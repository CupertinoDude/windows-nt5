<p>
The FAX software can be installed from the FAXTORNADO server.  There are 2 shares on
the server that contain the necessary software: FAXBIN & SPOOLERBIN.

Installing The New Spooler
</h2>
The SPOOLERBIN share contains a new spooler that is necessary to send FAXes.  The
new spooler must be installed first, before the FAX server is installed.  The spooler
installation requires that your system be restarted.  To install the new spooler
go to the subdirectory for the platform on which the spooler will run (i386, mips, alpha, or ppc),
and run the INSTALL.CMD script.  After your system restarts you will be running the new spooler.
<p>
<h2>
Installing The FAX Software
</h2>
The FAXBIN share contains the fax server software.  There are subdirectories for each
NT platform (i386, mips, alpha, or ppc) that contains the FAX software and the setup
program.  To install the FAX software, go to the subdirectory for the platform on which
the FAX software will run and start the FAXSETUP program.  The setup program detects
if you are running NT Server or NT Workstation and run the appropriate type of setup.
If you are running NT Server, then you will get a FAX Server installation, otherwise
if you are running NT Workstation you get the FAX Network Client install.  The setup
type can be overriden by using the -tc switch to the FAXSETUP program.  To select Server
install use -ts and for the Network Clientr use -tc.
<p>
If you install the Network Client, you will be asked for a FAX printer name on the
first setup wizard page.  You should use the name: \\FAXTORNADO\NTDEVFAX.  This is
the FAX server that is maintained by the FAX group.  The server has 4 phone lines
that allow you to send and receive FAXes outside of Microsoft.
