To receive a FAX on the FaxTornado server you'll need to specify the
phone number for the sender to use.  Below is a list of available
phone numbers that are attached to the server.  When a FAX is received
a TIFF file is created in the \\FaxTornado\FaxReceive share.
<p>
Until we get some more of the functionality online you will have to
look at the share for the TIFF file.  In light of this fact, you
probably don't want to receive any confidential information on
the server.
