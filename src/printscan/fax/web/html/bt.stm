Windows NT Drivers for Brooktrout FAX Boards

<P>
The Brooktrout device drivers and TAPI software is located on
\\FAXTORNADO\BROOKTROUT.  The software is usable only on an
x86 machine running a current build of Windows NT 4.0 (Build 1294 or greater).
<p>
To install the software simply connect to the share point and run the
setup program.  After the installation is complete, all you need to do
is change the driver to start automatically when the system boots.   To
change this, use the devices control panel applet.
