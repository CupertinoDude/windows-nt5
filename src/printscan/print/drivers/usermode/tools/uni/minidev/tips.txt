To start the Minidriver Conversion Wizard, select New from the File menu. You can obtain help by pressing F1.  Try looking at a few more tips before you begin.

Context menus are available for items within a minidriver workspace's Component View, as well as for many items within the UFM and GTT editors. To view a context menu, place the mouse cursor over the item and click the right mouse button.

You can rename a workspace, or any of the files within it, by changing the name within the workspace's Component View. To rename an item, place the mouse cursor over the item and click the right mouse button to display its context menu.

You can often obtain help for a task you are performing by pressing F1. Additionally, you can always use the Help menu.

Adding or removing code points in a glyph translation table (GTT) invalidates the width information for variable-pitch fonts that use the table. This might make the font unusable, because font widths are stored in UFM files by index into the GTT, and not by Unicode code point.

When using the GTT editor, be careful when changing the selected code page for a code point. The editor does not verify that the code point is defined in the new code page.

In the Add Code Points dialog you can select and add a single code point, or you can simultaneously select and add multiple code points.

Lists of items in columns can be sorted by column, if the column has a title box. To sort by column, click the column's title box. To reverse the list order, click the title box again. Precedence can be set by sorting less significant columns first.

Font selection strings are represented in C-language string literal format, except that the octal escape (\nnn) is not allowed.

To view lists of code pages installed on your system and code pages that Windows NT supports, select About from the Help menu.

You can move a toolbar to any side of the main frame, or float it, by dragging it from its current position.  MDT saves the new toolbar location.

You can edit a UFM, GTT, or GPD file by opening it in the Windows NT Explorer.

Using the Conversion Wizard is currently the only way to create a new workspace.  In the final version of MDT, you will be able to create an empty workspace. You will be able to import GPD files into a workspace, and move them from one workspace to another.

In the final version of MDT, adding, deleting, and importing GTT and UFM files will be supported.

When moving a GPD file from one workspace to another, you must delete it from the first workspace.

In the UFM Editor, the average character width is calculated from other font settings. You cannot alter the average character width directly.

The Conversion Wizard sets a font's capital H height and lowercase X height to 0.  GDI will calculate default values.

The font used for character animation on the UFM editor's General Metrics page is the available TrueType font that most closely matches the specified metrics (including Family type).

You might have to edit the RC file after using the Conversion Wizard.  For instance, a Win16 minidriver's header files might not be appropriate for building a Windows NT minidriver.

Win16 minidrivers require you to define encodings for a continuous range of characters, so duplicate encodings of the default character set often exist. You can save space and time by removing these duplicates from your GTT files.  To quickly find them, sort the code points by clicking the Selection String column title. Then delete them with the Delete key.

You can use the workspace to change where a GPD file is saved. To do so, move the mouse cursor over the GPD file's filename in the workspace's Component View. Click the right mouse button and select the Rename option. This display's the file's path, which you can edit. When you subsequently choose Save, Close, or Exit from the File menu, the GPD file will be moved.
