You can obtain help by using the Help menu, by clicking on the toolbar's question mark, or by pressing F1.

Context menus are available for items within a minidriver workspace's Component View, as well as for many items within the UFM and GTT editors. To view a context menu, place the mouse cursor over the item and click the right mouse button.

You can rename a workspace, or any of the files within it, by changing the name within the workspace's Component View. To rename an item, place the mouse cursor over the item and click the right mouse button to display its context menu.

Adding or removing code points in a glyph translation table (GTT) invalidates the width information for variable-pitch fonts that use the table. This might make the font unusable, because font widths are stored in UFM files by index into the GTT, and not by Unicode code point.

When using the GTT editor, be careful when changing the selected code page for a code point. The editor does not verify that the code point is defined in the new code page.

In the Add Code Points dialog you can select and add a single code point, or you can simultaneously select and add multiple code points.

Lists of items in columns can be sorted by column, if the column has a title box. To sort by column, click the column's title box. To reverse the list order, click the title box again. 

Font selection strings are represented in C-language string literal format, except that the octal escape (\nnn) is not allowed.

To view lists of code pages installed on your system and code pages that Windows 2000 supports, select About from the Help menu.

You can edit a UFM, GTT, or GPD file by opening it in the Windows Explorer.

When moving a GPD file from one workspace to another, you must delete it from the first workspace.

The Conversion Wizard sets a font's capital H height and lowercase X height to 0.  GDI will calculate default values.

Win16 minidrivers require you to define encodings for a continuous range of characters, so duplicate encodings of the default character set often exist. You can save space and time by removing these duplicates from your GTT files.  To quickly find them, sort the code points by clicking the Selection String column title in the GTT editor. Then delete duplicates with the Delete key.

You can use the workspace to change where a GPD file is saved. To do so, move the mouse cursor over the GPD file's filename in the workspace's Component View. Click the right mouse button and select the Rename option. This display's the file's path, which you can edit. When you subsequently choose Save, Close, or Exit from the File menu, the GPD file will be moved.
