=== #96199: Part of vertical line is not printed: 3/4/98 yasuho ===

This is hardware restriction. Some of dots doesn't printed in default
printing speed. (Default is high speed) If you'd like to see correct image,
you should be change to "normal speed" by printer hardware setting.
(See manual)

We'd like to support the "change of printing speed" (like a "econo-mode"
for HPPCL) option in the future if possible to change it from software.
