  lGlyphSetDataRCID of UFM files in ufm\ are changed to include 
  UFMs/GTTs of pcl5jre2. They are not the same to original ID from OEM.

  All font resources were deleted because we can share them with pcl5eres.
  If you will use this dll for models with device fonts, you should write its GPD file
  like fxab2e1j.gpd, fxdc4e1j.gpd and fxdc5e1j.gpd in gpd\fx\jpn\.
