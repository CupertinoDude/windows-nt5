Abstract:

    Data structures  used for reading the common font installer file format.
    Typically used by drivers during font counting and enumeration at
    EnabldPDEV() time - at the time of writing!  Subject to change as the
    DDI/GDI change.

Environment:

    Windows NT Unidrv driver

/*
 *   The following structure is returned from the FIOpenRead() function,
 * and contains the basic information needed to access the data in the
 * file once it is memory mapped.
 */

typedef  struct
{
    HANDLE hFont;               /* Font installer file, for downloaded part */
    BYTE  *pbBase;              /* Base address of data as mapped */
    void  *pvFix;               /* Fixed part at start of file */
    ULONG  ulFixSize;           /* Bytes in fixed data record */

/*
 *      Definitions used in the font file.  This is the file which holds
 *      information about cartridge and download fonts.  The file format
 *      is quite basic:  a header for verification; then an array of
 *      records,  each with a header.  These records contain FONTMAP
 *      information.  Cartridges have an array of these, one for each
 *      font.  Finally,  the tail of the file contains extra data, as
 *      required.  For download fonts,  this would be the download data.
 *
 */


/*
 *   The file header.   One of these is located at the beginning of the file.
 *  The ulVarData field is relative to the beginning of the file.  This
 *  makes it easier to regenerate the file when fonts are deleted.

/*
 *   Each entry in the file starts with the following header.  Typically
 * there will be one of these for a softfont, and one per cartridge.
 * In the case of a cartridge,  there will be an array of these, within
 * the master entry.  Each sub-entry will be for one specific font.
 *
 *   Note that there is a dummy entry at the end.  This contains a 0
 * in the ulSize field - it is to mark the last one,  and makes it
 * easier to manipulate the file.
