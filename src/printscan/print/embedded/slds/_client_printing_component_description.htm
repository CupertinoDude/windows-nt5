<P>This component enables a thin client that can print to a printer server through a remote procedure call (RPC) printer connection. This component is very useful because an embedded system does not necessarily have the CPU power to render a print job.</P>

<P>The Client Printing component supports only RPC printer connections because there are no drivers in this component. A print queue must be added before any printing service is available. This can be done through Point and Print or through the Add Printer Wizard in the remote Printers and Faxes folder. A printer queue is a logical printer that consists of configuration data, as well as queue-specific and driver-specific resources. Queue-specific and driver-specific resources are included in the Microsoft Inbox printer driver component, while configuration data consisting of registry data and driver configuration data files are generated dynamically at the time of printer installation.</P>

<H1>Component Configuration</H1>

<P>There are no configuration requirements for this component.</P>
