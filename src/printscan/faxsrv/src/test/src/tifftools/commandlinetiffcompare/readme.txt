VBTestit is a version of Testit.exe that also saves the test results to file testit.out
This is for use from VB tests (that require comparing tiff files), because we were not able to make a VB call into tifftolls.dll itself.

Note that this is a VC project only (no razzle) because currently no VB for 64bit exists.
We may add a razzle project later.
