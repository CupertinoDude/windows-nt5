<h1>BVT for legacy COM API</h1>
<h3>Basic Verification Test for COM API of Whistler and Win2000</h3>
<h4>Automatic send files, and compare source with file that was received</h4>
<p>This program will test fax sending over COM API for Win2000 Fax and Whistler Fax
A .BVT file will contain Test Cases. Each Test Case is a list of Source File, Reference File, and Source Cover Page. 
This program will send the source file with/without the source cover page, then it will poll the modems, and then it will compare the files in the Archive (outbound), and Store In Folder of the routing method (Store) directories, with the reference files. 
If the reference file is the same as the files that where created and send by the fax, the BVT Passed.
