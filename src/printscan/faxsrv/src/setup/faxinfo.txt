What Is Personal Fax for Windows?
----------------------------------------------------------

Personal Fax for Windows is a program you use to send and 
receive faxes from a computer running Windows NT Workstation. 
Personal Fax for Windows converts all outgoing and incoming 
faxes to .TIF-formatted files, which you can print or view 
and store online.
 
Think of your fax modem or other fax device as a printer. 
You send faxes in the same way you print ordinary documents.
 
Note: Personal Fax for Windows supports one fax device at 
a time. Other networked users cannot send or receive faxes 
through your computer.

----------------------------------------------------------
Sending Faxes
----------------------------------------------------------

You can send a fax in any of three ways:

x	You can fax an open document directly from its 
	application simply by selecting your fax printer as 
	your target printer. On the File menu of the application, 
	click Print (or Send), and the Fax Send Utility opens 
	to guide you through each step. It’s easy.

x	You can use the Fax Send Utility (Start/Programs/Fax) to
	create your fax on-the-fly. Use this method only when you do 
	not need to include file attachments.

x	You can send a fax from Exchange using special fax 
	addresses you define in your personal address book. When you 
	select a recipient whose address is a fax address, the e-mail 
	that you type becomes your fax. Using Exchange, you can 
	simultaneously send a message to both fax and e-mail 
	recipients. You can also include file attachments within the 
	messages. A copy of each fax you send is stored in the Sent 
	folder, just as e-mail messages are.

Regardless of the method you use to send your fax, you’ll 
automatically be notified by e-mail whether or not your fax 
transmission was successful.

You can also archive copies of all outgoing faxes in a designated 
folder on your hard disk. 

Personal Fax for Windows provides several standard cover pages and 
a handy cover-page editor you can use to create or modify your own. 

----------------------------------------------------------
Receiving Faxes
----------------------------------------------------------

To view a received fax online, use the Fax Document Viewer 
(Start/Programs/Fax). You can combine any of the following methods 
for dealing with the faxes you receive.

x	You can automatically route all incoming faxes to a folder on 
	your computer or on another networked computer.

x	You can automatically print each fax upon arrival.

x	You can automatically receive faxes as mail messages in your 
	Exchange Inbox.

----------------------------------------------------------
Setting Up Your Modem and Configuring Your Workstation Fax
----------------------------------------------------------

First, install your fax modem in your computer according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Please see the release notes for 
a list of supported modems.

Personal Fax For Windows adds a Fax properties application to your 
Control Panel (Start/Settings/Control Panel).
 
Next, use the Fax properties application to specify fax settings, 
such as:

x	Your name, fax number, and other personal information you 
	want to include on the cover pages of outgoing faxes.

x	Paper size, image quality, and page orientation.

x	The number of times you want the modem to redial after 
	an unsuccessful call attempt, and the interval between 
	redials.

x	How you want to handle incoming faxes.

x	Whether to send the fax immediately or at another time, 
	such as during off-peak hours when usage and long-distance 
	phone rates are lower.

x	The cover page you want to use. 

x	The logging-priority level for successful and unsuccessful 
	fax events. You can view fax events in the Event Viewer, 
	which you can find under Start/Programs/Administrator Tools.
