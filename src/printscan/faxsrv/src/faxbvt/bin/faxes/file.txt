Fax Service BVT

Goal:
To verify that the Fax Server can correctly perform the basic functions required.

Test Areas:
Send a fax (with/without CP, single/broadcast, from applications/wizard/API).
Receive a fax (verify bit map, banner, number of pages).
Automated image verification is not implemented.
Abort an outgoing/incoming fax (while pending, sending, receiving).
Inbound Routing (to Folder, to printer, to mail).
Testing of inbound to mail is not implemented.
Simultaneous use of multiple devices (for send/receive).
Test not implemented (due to 2 device limit => needs 2 machines)
Fax Management settings (device settings, user profile, routing).
Test not implemented.

Pre-requisites:
In order to run this BVT a machine with the build in question must be properly installed. 
Two modems must be installed on the machine (device#1 and device#2).
A printer must be installed on the machine.
See additional BVT setup information in appendix A. 
Any test case specific setup is described in the "Setup" section of each test case.
