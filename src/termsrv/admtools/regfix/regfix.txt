Detailed Informaton:

 When installing Windows Terminal Server, if you are unable to upgrade an 
 existing Windows NT Server 3.51 or Citrix WinFrame 1.x server, use this 
 utility to allow the installation to be upgraded.  In order to run this 
 utility, you will have to run it from another NT installation, so that you 
 can safely modify the registry file.  Here is the procedure to follow: 

 - Boot the system to an alternate NT partition
                  
 - Change to the \WinFrame\system32\config directory of the WinFrame (or NT) 
   partition to be updated
	cd \winframe\system32\config
 
 - rename the software hive to software.sav
	ren software software.sav
 
 - fix the registry file (assuming that d: is your CDROM drive)
	d:\support\regfix\regfix software.sav software
 
 - restart the Windows Terminal Server Install
