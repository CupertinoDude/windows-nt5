"DANGER, DANGER, Will Robinson!" -- Robot, Lost In Space, circa mid 1960's

When editing these .RTF files with Microsoft Word for Windows (version 6.x, 
etc), make sure that you have turned OFF the following options (they are ON by
default):

        Tools, AutoCorrect, 
                Change 'Straight Quotes' to 'Smart Quotes'

        Tools, Options..., AutoFormat, Replace group
                Straight Quotes with Smart Quotes

If you don't do this, WinWord will eat all of your single quotes and replace
them with 'smart quotes' that the help file generator does not understand,
resulting in missing single quotes throughout the document.  It's also a real
pain to get your single quotes back once this happens, so check before you
save!
