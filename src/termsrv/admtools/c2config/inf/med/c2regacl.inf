;   Registry ACL definition file
;
;   Use this file to set the registry key ACL's to the desired
;   security. The format of each entry is:
;
;       [RegistryKey]
;       Domain\Account = [INHERIT,] access [, access]...
;
;   where:
;
;     RegistryKey is the key path of the key to set. This is in the
;     format of:
;
;           PREDEFINED_KEY\[path | *]
;       where:
;
;           PREDEFINED_KEY is one of:
;               HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
;               HKEY_USERS
;               HKEY_CURRENT_USER
;               HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
;
;         and
;           path is the path to the key. The path may end in a "*"
;           character in which case, all sub-keys of the specified
;           path will be set to the specified security
;
;       for example:
;
;           [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\*]
;
;               would assign the security description of that section
;               to all keys UNDER the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft
;               key but NOT to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft
;               key itself. To assign security to that key, an entry
;               such as the following would be needed:
;
;               [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft]
;
;
;   Domain\Account
;       specifies the account to recieve the specified access for that
;       key. Account may be an account or a group. For Example to give
;       permissions to all administrator accounts, the:
;
;           BUILTIN\Administrators
;
;       would be the correct entry.
;
;   access is defined as one of the following:
;
;       QV  = Query Value
;       SV  = Set Value
;       CS  = Create Subkey
;       ES  = Enumerate Subkeys
;       NT  = Notify
;       CL  = Create Link
;
;       DE  = Delete
;       RC  = Read Control
;       WD  = Write DAC
;       WO  = Write Owner
;
;   there are also some predefined combination access keys:
;
;       NONE = no access
;       FULL = QV, SV, CS, ES, NT, CL, DE, WD, WO, RC
;       READ = QV, ES, NT, RC
;
;   The 'INHERIT' string can be specified (in the first entry only)
;   to indicate this is the access control to be assigned by default
;   to created subkeys.
