REM 
REM   Before running this application compatibility script, you must 
REM   designate a drive letter, that is not already in use for   
REM   Terminal Server, to be mapped to each user's home directory. 
REM   Update the "Set RootDrive" statement at the end of 
REM   this file to indicate the desired drive letter.  If you have 
REM   no preference, the drive W: is suggested.  For example: 
REM 
REM            Set RootDrive=W: 
REM 
REM   Note:  Make sure there are no spaces after the drive letter and colon. 
REM 
REM   When you have completed this task, save this file and exit 
REM   NotePad to continue running the application compatibility script. 
REM 
 
Set RootDrive=
