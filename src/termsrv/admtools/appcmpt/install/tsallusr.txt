The TsAllUsr program is a temporary stand-alone application that
contains functionality which will be added to the change user
program.

If you run TsAllUsr without any parameters, it will take a snapshot
of the Current User's Start Menu.  (This is saved in a file in the
%userprofile% directory.)  Later, this functionality will be moved
to "change user /install".

Next, install the application.  The application will add/update
the Current User's Start menu.

After the installation has completed, use "TsAllUsr /c" to move
new or updated Start menu shortcuts from the Current User Start
menu to the All Users start menu.  TsAllUsr also adds read permission
for Everyone.  This functionality will be moved to "change user /execute".
