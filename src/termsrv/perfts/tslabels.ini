// Input

INWDBYTES_009_NAME=Input WdBytes
INWDBYTES_009_HELP=Number of bytes input on this session after all protocol overhead has been removed.

INWDFRAMES_009_NAME=Input WdFrames
INWDFRAMES_009_HELP=The number of frames input after any additional protocol added frames have been removed.

INWAITFOROUTBUF_009_NAME=Input WaitForOutBuf
INWAITFOROUTBUF_009_HELP=The number of times that a wait for an available send buffer was done by the protocols on the client side of the connection.

INFRAMES_009_NAME=Input Frames
INFRAMES_009_HELP=Number of frames (packets) input on this Session.

INBYTES_009_NAME=Input Bytes
INBYTES_009_HELP=Number of bytes input on this session that includes all protocol overhead.

INCOMPBYTES_009_NAME=Input Compressed Bytes
INCOMPBYTES_009_HELP=Number of bytes input after compression. This number compared with the Total Bytes input is the compression ratio.

INCOMPFLUSHES_009_NAME=Input Compress Flushes
INCOMPFLUSHES_009_HELP=Number of input compression dictionary flushes. When the data can not be compressed, the compression dictionary is flushed so that newer data has a better chance of being compressed. Some causes of data not compressing includes transferring compressed files over Client Drive Mapping.

INERRORS_009_NAME=Input Errors
INERRORS_009_HELP=Number of input errors of all types. Some example input errors are lost ACK's, badly formed packets, etc.

INTIMEOUTS_009_NAME=Input Timeouts
INTIMEOUTS_009_HELP=The total number of timeouts on the communication line as seen from the client side of the connection. These are typically the result of a noisy line. On some high latency networks, this could be the result of the protocol timeout being too short. Increasing the protocol timeout on these types of lines will improve performance by reducing needless re-transmissions.

INASYNCFRAMEERR_009_NAME=Input Async Frame Error
INASYNCFRAMEERR_009_HELP=Number of input async framing errors. These can be caused by a noisy transmission line. Using a smaller packet size may help in some cases.

INASYNCOVERRUN_009_NAME=Input Async Overrun
INASYNCOVERRUN_009_HELP=Number of input async overrun errors. These can be caused by the baud rate being faster than the computer can handle, or a non-16550 serial line is used. Overruns can also occur if too many high speed serial lines are active at one time for the processor's power.

INASYNCOVERFLOW_009_NAME=Input Async Overflow
INASYNCOVERFLOW_009_HELP=Number of input async overflow errors. These can be caused by a lack of buffer space available on the host.

INASYNCPARITY_009_NAME=Input Async Parity Error
INASYNCPARITY_009_HELP=Number of input async parity errors. These can be caused by a noisy transmission line

INTDERRORS_009_NAME=Input Transport Errors
INTDERRORS_009_HELP=Number of Terminal Services transport-level errors on input.
