; All shipping DLLs must specify default base address here.
; Non-shipping DLLs must set "BaseOpt=" in the makefile.
; Processes do not need to set BaseOpt nor be listed here.
;
; Base addresses optimize performance by reducing time
; searching for a load address and fixing up relocations.
;
; NT and Win95 automatically rebase our DLLs for optimum
; packing, so these arbitrary base addresses prevent a
; performance degradation when using unofficial builds.
;
; Each base address should be greater than previous
; row's base address plus the maximum size.
