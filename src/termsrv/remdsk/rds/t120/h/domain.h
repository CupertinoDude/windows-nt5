 *
 *	Abstract:
 *		This is the interface file for the domain class.  This class contains
 *		all code necessary to maintain a domain information base within the
 *		MCS system.  When a domain object is first created, it is completely
 *		empty.  That is, it has no user attachments, no MCS connections, and
 *		therefore no outstanding resources, such as channels and tokens.
 *
 *		A word of caution about terminology.  Throughout the MCS documentation
 *		the word "attachment" is used in conjunction with a USER attachment. The
 *		word "connection" is used in conjunction with a TRANSPORT connection. In
 *		this class, the two types of "attachments" are NOT differentiated (most
 *		of the time).  They are both referred to as attachments.  When deleting
 *		an attachment, it is necessary to know the difference, however, and so
 *		there is an enumerated type (AttachmentType) to distinguish.  The type
 *		of each attachment is stored in a dictionary for easy access (see
 *		description of AttachmentType below).
 *
 *		This class keeps a list of "attachments" that are hierarchically below
 *		the local provider within the domain.  It also keeps a pointer to the
 *		one attachment that is hierarchically above the local provider (if any).
 *
 *		Since this class inherits from CommandTarget, it processes MCS commands
 *		as member function calls (see cmdtar.h for a description of how this
 *		mechanism works).  In essence, domain objects are just big command
 *		routers who react to incoming commands according to the contents of the
 *		information base.  That information base, in turn, is modified by the
 *		commands that are handled.
 *
 *		Domain objects keep lists of both channel objects and token objects,
 *		who maintain information about the current state of various channels
 *		and tokens.  Objects of this class are the heart of MCS.
 *
 *	Caveats:
 *		None.

 *

 *
 *	Side Effects:

 *
 *	Caveats:

/*
 *	~Domain ()
 *
 *	Functional Description:
 *		This is the destructor for the domain class.  It purges the entire
 *		domain by first sending disconnect provider ultimatums to ALL
 *		attachments (both user attachments and MCS connections).  It then frees
 *		up all resources in use by the domain (which is just objects in its
 *		various containers).
 *
 *		Note that doing this will result in all user attachments and MCS
 *		connections being broken.  Furthermore, all providers that are
 *		hierarchically below this one, will respond by purging their domains
 *		as well.
 *
 *	Formal Parameters:
 *		None.
 *
 *	Return Value:
 *		None.
 *
 *	Side Effects:
 *		The domain from this provider downward is completely eradicated.
 *
 *	Caveats:
 *		None.

 *
 *	Formal Parameters:
 *		None.
 *
 *	Return Value:
 *		TRUE if this is the top provider.  FALSE otherwise.

/*
 *	Void	GetDomainParameters (

 *
 *	Functional Description:
 *		This function is used to ask the domain what the minimum and maximum
 *		acceptable values for domain parameters are.  If the domain has no
 *		connections (and therefore has not yet locked its domain parameters),
 *		then it will return min and max values based on what it can handle.
 *		If it has locked its domain parameters, then both the min and max values
 *		will be set to the locked set (indicating that it will not accept
 *		anything else).
 *
 *	Formal Parameters:
 *		domain_parameters (o)
 *			Pointer to a structure to be filled with the current domain
 *			parameters (those that are in use).  Setting this to NULL will
 *			prevent current domain parameters from being returned.
 *		min_domain_parameters (o)
 *			Pointer to a structure to be filled with the minimum domain
 *			parameters.  Setting this to NULL will prevent minimum domain
 *			parameters from being returned.
 *		max_domain_parameters (o)
 *			Pointer to a structure to be filled with the maximum domain
 *			parameters.  Setting this to NULL will prevent maximum domain
 *			parameters from being returned.
 *

 *
 *	Functional Description:
 *		This function is used when an attachment wishes to bind itself to the
 *		domain.  This will occur only after the connection has been been
 *		completely and successfully negotiated.
 *
 *	Formal Parameters:
 *		originator (i)
 *			This is the attachment that wishes to bind.
 *		upward_connection (i)
 *			A boolean flag indicating whether or not this is an upward
 *			connection.
 *		domain_parameters (i)
 *			A pointer to a domain parameters structure that holds the parameters
 *			that were negotiated for the connection.  If the domain has not
 *			already locked its parameters, it will accept and lock these.
 *		attachment_type (i)
 *			What type of attachment is this (local or remote).
 *
 *	Return Value:
 *		None.
 *
 *	Side Effects:
 *		None.
 *
 *	Caveats:
 *		None.

 *		the connection to the top provder will be severed.  If its not, then
 *		it will be decremented and broadcast to all downward attachments.
 *
 *	Formal Parameters:
 *		originator (i)
 *			This is the attachment from which the command originated.
 *		height_limit (i)

 *	Functional Description:
 *		This member function represents the reception of an erect domain request
 *		from one of its downward attachments.  This contains information needed

 *
 *	Formal Parameters:

 *		a lower domain, the confirm will contain information indicating
 *		acceptance or rejection of the named channel.  If a channel is rejected,
 *		the former top provider will issue a purge channel indication

 *	Functional Description:
