// Queued responses to control requests.  We try to send them right away,
// but that can fail.  
// Here's the logic:
//      
// (1) For TAKING/RELEASING control (viewer)
//     There's only one at most pending.  That's because a pending RELEASE
//          cancels out a pending TAKE.  
//
// (2) For RESPONDING/REVOKING control (host)
//     These never cancel out.  Each one will have a successive sequence ID.
//          There should NEVER be a pending BOUNCE in the queue with a 
//          pending RESPOND for the same controller/request ID.  Of course not,
//          since we don't change our state until the packet goes out,
//          and if the RESPOND CONFIRM packet hasn't gone out, we wouldn't
//          be bouncing anybody.
//      
// Outgoing requests take precedence over incoming ones.  In other words,
// if the UI/user/SDK code asks us to take control of a remote, we will
// turn any pending RESPOND CONFIRM packets into RESPOND DENIED ones.  If
// we are in control of another already, take will fail, it's the intermediate
// phase that's undoable only.
//
// Here's the basic logic flow to TAKE CONTROL:
//      Viewer makes new sequence ID
//      Viewer sends private packet to host, requesting control
//      Viewer changes state to "asked for control"
//      Host receives private packet
//      Host sends private response packet to viewer, confirming or denying control
//      If confirming, host broadcasts notification to everybody sometime
//          later.
//      When viewer gets response, viewer moves to incontrol state, or
//          backs off
//
// Here's the basic logic flow to RELEASE CONTROL:
//      Viewer initiated:
//          Send INFORM RELEASED private packet to host
//          Change state to not in control
//          Host receives private packet
//          Host ignores if out of date (bounced already or whatever)
//          Host changes state to not controlled otherwise
//      Host initiated:
//          Send INFORM BOUNCED private packet to viewer
//          Change state to not controlled
//          Viewer receives private packet
//          Viewer ignores if out of date (released already or whatever)
//          Viewer changes state to not in control otherwise
//
// While pending take control, waiting to here confirmation, or in control
//      pending requests to control us are denied.
