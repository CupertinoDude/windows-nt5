Tool for OEM NTFS-alignment-aware FAT formatting under DOS environments. The source
here is modified from the format source in the 9x source tree and does NOT compile
under the NT build environment. Aside from the message file in messages\usa-ms (to
match the 9x convention), the include files external to the format source are not
present.

OFORMAT.MAK is the 9x build makefile, not a VC++ generated makefile.
