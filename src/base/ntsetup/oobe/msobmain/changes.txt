This file details changes made to files in this directory to port the code from
the Win9x tree to the Whistler tree.

* Added sources file and standard NT makefile.  
* Removed msobmain.mk and Win9x makefile. 
* Moved files from messages\usa to root.
* Moved version info from msobmain.rcv to msobmain.rc.
* Removed msobmain.rcv.
* Commented out DESCRIPTION line in msobmain.def to fix: warning LNK4017:
  DESCRIPTION statement not supported for the target platform; ignored
* Mapped symbols in DEF file exports table to actual symbol names in
  obcommon.lib to resolve unresolved externals.
* Removed definitions for cszEqual, cszAmpersand, cszPlus, and cszQuestion from
  htmparse.cpp.  They are already defined in appdefs.h.
* Included shellapi.h in main.cpp and msobmain.cpp for ShellExecute.
* Added void return type to CProductID::SaveState in pid.h and pid.cpp.
* Moved icon resources from messages\usa to res.
* Where BOOL values are mapped to VARIANT_BOOLs use Bool2VarBool to map 0 to 0
  and non-zero to -1.
* #if 0'd all calls to 16-bit code.
* changed _DEBUG to DBG.
* eula.cpp: CEula::ValidateEULA now calls the ValidateEula stub in msobstub.lib
  instead of calling setupx directly to get the path to a valid eula file.
* sources: added msobstub.lib to TARGETLIBS
* msobmain.cpp: 
    * Fixed bug in CObMain::Invoke(DISPID_EXTERNAL_DIAL).  Scripts
      sometimes called window.external.dial with a BSTR as the first parameter,
      sometimes with an integer.  Handler code tried to convert parameter from
      wide chars to ascii in both cases.

      Solution: Rewrote the code for
      DISPID_EXTERNAL_DIAL/REDIAL/DIALEX/REDIALEX. 
      * For DIAL/REDIAL: Changed parameter passing so that two params are
        required
        * first param is always connection type 
        * second param is always isp file name
      * For DIALEX/REDIALEX: Changed parameter passing so that three parameters
        are required:
        * first param is always connection type, second param is always isp file
        * name, optional third param is migration isp index. 
      * Moved common code to CObMain;:OnDial method.
* msobmain.h:
    * Added prototype for CObMain::OnDial( )
* sysclock.h:
    * definition of TIME_ZONE_REGKEY depends on platform
* msobmain.cpp
    * CObMain::Invoke(DISPID_EXTERNAL_FINISH)
        * Set fFinish to TRUE if WINNT.  This will change when PID validation
          is available for syssetup.
    * MainWndProc
        * Added case for WM_OBCOMM_DIAL_DONE
* pid.cpp
    * CProductID::ValidatePID
        * ifdef WINNT set m_dwPidState to PID_STATE_VALID
        * set *pbIsValid to TRUE
    * CProductID::get_PIDAcceptance
        * ifdef WINNT always return TRUE
* msobmain.cpp, pid.cpp, userinfo.cpp, language.cpp, tapiloc.cpp,
  tapiloc.h sysclock.h
  * changed _NT_ to WINNT
