This file details changes made to files in this directory to port the code from
the Win9x tree to the Whistler tree.

* Added sources file and standard NT makefile.  
* Removed msobcomm.mk and Win9x makefile. 
* Changed condition of #if in rnaapi.cpp\RasGetEntryProperties from WINVER !=
  0x400 to WINVER < 0x400.  This is potentially dangerous because the code was
  hand tuned to windows ver 4.  In fact, ChrisK said that there is a security
  hole here somewhere that was not fixed because the cost was higher than the
  risk.
* Removed definition of RASAUTODIALENTRY from inshdlr.h.  It is defined in
  ras.h.
* Removed definition for RASDT_Atm obcomglb.h.  Already defined in ras.h.
* Moved msobcomm.rc and resources.h from messages\usa to root.  Removed all
  references to messages\usa.
* Moved version info from msobcomm.rcv to msobcomm.rc.
* Removed msobcomm.rcv and msobcomm.aps.
* Included tchar.h in obcomglb.h for TCHAR and related macros.
* Removed include <netmpr.h> from ienews.cpp.  Not needed in NT build.
* Changed return value of Sz2W from int to WORD since that is what it is really
  returning.
* Changed parameter of GetSz from WORD to DWORD.  This was causing a data
  conversion error when GetSz was called with a resource ID.
* Cast return value from Sz2W in StrToSubip to BYTE to resolve data conversion
  error.
* Mapped symbols in DEF file exports table to actual symbol names in
  obcommon.lib to resolve unresolved externals.
* Commented out DESCRIPTION in msobcomm.def to resolve LNK4017 (DESCRIPTION
  statement not supported for the target platform; ignored)
* Included shellapi.h for ShellExecute
* changed _DEBUG to DBG.
* Fixed invalid handle exception during shutdown.
    * refdial.cpp: initialized m_hDialThread to NULL in constructor.
* import.cpp: CISPImport::ImportConnection
    * call to Rnaapi.InetConfigClientEx now takes szDefPhoneBook as second
      parameter instead of NULL.  
        * NT: szDefPhoneBook points to an null-terminated
          string containing the fully qualified path to the default phone.  
        * Win9x: szDefPhoneBook is NULL.
* misc.cpp
    * include shlobj.h, assert.h
    * added GetCommonAppDataDirectory( ): wrapper around 
      SHGetFolderPath(CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA)
    * added GetDefaultPhoneBook( ): returns fully qualified path to rasphone.pbk
* obcomglb.h
    * added prototypes for
        * GetCommonAppDataDirectory
        * GetDefaultPhoneBook
* sources
    * added shfolder.lib to TARGETLIBS for SHGetFolderPath
* refdial.cpp
    * CRefDial::CRefDial: initialized BSTRs.  Fixed AV due to freeing
      uninitialized memory.
    * CRefDial::~CRefDial: wait for threads to finish before exiting
      destructor.  Fixed AV due to closing invalid thread handle.
* msobcomm.cpp, msobcomm.h, refdial.cpp, refdial.h
    Added OnDialEvent method.  This creates a way to notify the communication
    manager of dialing thread state: particularly that the thread is exiting.
    This fixes an AV that occurred because CRefDial was trying to close the
    handle of a non-existent thread (m_hDialThread) in the destructor.
* refdial.cpp, msobcomm.cpp, import.cpp,rnaapi.cpp
    * changed _NT_ to WINNT
