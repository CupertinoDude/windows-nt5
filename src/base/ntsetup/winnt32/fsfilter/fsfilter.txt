This component appears to use a type of device driver called a file
system filter driver. File system filter drivers allow other companies to write programs that can access files on your hard disks. They are typically
used in products such as virus checkers or backup applications, but may also be 
used with storage devices like CD-ROMs, 'jukeboxes', or tape drives. 

This particular driver has not been tested with Microsoft Windows 2000, and you should not continue to upgrade with this driver loaded. However, your computer does not have enough information to identify which add-on product is using this driver.

You can proceed by doing one of the following:

1. Identify and uninstall the program that is using this driver. Sometimes the driver name clearly identifies which product uses it. A current list of driver names and the programs that use them can be found in the Release Notes on your Windows 2000 CD, or at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/deploy/fileprint/fsfilteruse.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Devices. Find the entry for this driver, click <B>Startup</B>, and then click Disabled. Click OK, click Close, and then restart your computer. Restart Windows 2000 Setup. You can proceed with the upgrade, but the product that
was using this driver will not function properly now.

For a list of devices supported by Windows 2000, please see the Microsoft Windows 2000 Hardware Compatibility List at  http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl. Your Windows 2000 CD includes a copy of this list (drive:\Support\hcl.txt) that was accurate as of the date Windows 2000 was released.
