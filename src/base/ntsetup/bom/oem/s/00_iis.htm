Welcome to Microsoft&#174; Internet Information Server version 2.0 for the Windows&nbsp;NT&#174; Server version 4.0 operating system. With Microsoft Internet Information Server, a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server becomes a high-volume, robust Web server that can publish information to users down the hall or around the world. Internet Information Server is ideal for corporate networks on Windows&nbsp;NT-based computers because you can set up powerful Web servers on your existing hardware. Internet Information Server is integrated into the Windows&nbsp;NT Server operating system and takes advantage of its security features and performance capabilities.
<P>Using Internet Information Server, you can develop a Web site that can be used to:
<ul>
<LI> Publish a &#147;home page&#148; on the Internet for your business featuring a newsletter, sales information, or employment opportunities.
<P>
<LI> Publish a catalog and take orders from customers.
<P>
<LI> Publish interactive programs.
<P>
<LI> Provide your remote sales force easy access to your sales database.
<P>
<LI> Use an order-tracking database.
<P>
<LI> Publish an employee handbook.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>
<BR>Internet Information Server also provides other information services and supports a variety of interfaces that you can use to develop other features for your Web site. You can:
<ul>
<LI> Create high performance client-server applications using the Microsoft Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI).
<P>
<LI> Customize the WWW Service by creating ISAPI filter programs that listen to incoming or outgoing requests and automatically perform actions, such as enhanced logging.
<P>
<LI> Run Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications or scripts.
<P>
<LI> Transmit or receive files using the FTP service.
<P>
<LI> Publish archives of information, spanning multiple computers, using the gopher service.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>Internet Information Server includes the following components:
<ul>
<LI> Internet services: WWW, FTP, and gopher.
<P>
<LI> Internet Service Manager, the tool for administering the Internet services.
<P>
<LI> Internet Database Connector, the component for sending queries to databases.
<P>
<LI> Key Manager, the tool for installing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) keys.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>After you have installed the Internet services, we recommend that you start Internet Explorer and browse through the samples and documentation. To start, type <b>http://</b><i><B>computername</b></i><b>/samples</b> in the <b>Address</b> box of Internet Explorer, where <i>computername</i> is the name of your computer.

</ul><!--Leh--><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 1h2"> Integration into Windows&nbsp;NT Version 4.0 Setup </a> </h2>Internet Information Server version 2.0 setup is fully integrated into Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 4.0 setup, allowing you to set up your Internet services while installing Windows&nbsp;NT Server. See Chapter 1, &#147;<a href="01_iis.htm">Installing Internet Information Server</a>,&#148; for more information.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 2h2"> Support for HTTP Host Header </a> </h2>For a server with only one Internet Protocol (IP) address (a single-hosted server), the host name will be returned in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to the browser on redirection. For example, if a client types an address requesting a directory and does not type the final slash mark, the host name (rather than the IP address) appears in the URL returned to the browser. You can configure the host name by using the TCP/IP property of the <b>Protocols</b> property sheet in the Network application of the Windows&nbsp;NT Control Panel. If no host name is configured, the domain name will be returned to the browser.
<P>For a server with more than one IP address (a multiple-hosted server, with virtual servers), the IP addresses will be returned.
<P>You can change this feature with the ReturnURLUsingHostName registry entry. See Chapter 10, &#147;<a href="10_iis.htm">Configuring Registry Entries</a>,&#148; for details.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 3h2"> NCSA Style Map Files </a> </h2>In addition to Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire (CERN) style map files, IIS version 2.0 NCSA style map files. This feature facilitates porting from systems (such as UNIX&#174;) that support NCSA mapping.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 4h2"> HTTP Byte Range </a> </h2>This feature enables a browser that supports byte range to copy part of a file from the server rather than the entire file. You can thus start receiving data at a particular place within a file, which is useful if a transmission is interrupted and you want to restart it where it left off, rather than recopy the entire file.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 5h2"> Enhanced Error Logging </a> </h2>Internet Information Server now logs errors as well as successful transactions. You can set your log files to record only errors, only successful transmissions, or both. You do this by editing the LogSuccessfulRequests and LogErrorRequests registry entries. See Chapter 10, &#147;<a href="10_iis.htm">Configuring Registry Entries</a>,&#148; for details.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 6h2"> Native Support for NCSA Common Log File Format </a> </h2>You can now choose between the Microsoft log file format and the NCSA Common Log File format. You no longer need to convert the Microsoft format to the NCSA format. See Chapter 7, &#147;<a href="07_iis.htm">Logging Server Activity</a>,&#148; for more information.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 7h2"> Translation of SQL Data to HTML Format </a> </h2>If you are publishing a database in a language with non-English characters, you can map special characters to HTML format. This feature lets browsers display characters unique to other languages (such as &agrave;, &#244;, and &#233;).
<P>See Chapter 8, &#147;<a href="08_iis.htm">Publishing Information and Applications</a>,&#148; for more details.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 8h2"> Server Variables in .idc Files </a> </h2>Internet Information Server version 2.0 supports adding the server variables to <i>if</i> statements in Internet Database Connector .idc files for database queries, using the %<i>variable</i>% notation in the .idc files.
<P>See Chapter 8, &#147;<a href="08_iis.htm">Publishing Information and Applications</a>,&#148; for more details.
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 9h2"> CGI Applications Receive Environment Variables </a> </h2>Internet Information Server now passes all environment variables defined in the CGI specification to CGI applications. For information on Internet Information Server&#146;s support for environment variables, see Chapter 8, &#147;<a href="08_iis.htm">Publishing Information and Applications</a>.&#148;
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 10h2"> Multiple Queries and Connection Pooling with Internet Database Connector </a> </h2>In Internet Database Connector files, you can now group SQL queries as batch queries or multiple queries to improve performance. For more information, see Chapter 8, &#147;<a href="08_iis.htm">Publishing Information and Applications</a>.&#148; 
<P>When running a series of Internet Database Connector files, you can now open a connection to the database and keep it open rather than opening and closing a connection each time the database is queried. Pooled connections may improve performance. For information on opening a connection pool for all .idc files, see the description of PoolIDCConnections in Chapter 10, &#147;<a href="10_iis.htm">Configuring the Registry</a>.&#148; For information on selecting which .idc files to include in a connection pool, see the description of the ODBC Connection field in Chapter 8, &#147;<a href="08_iis.htm">Publishing Information and Applications</a>.&#148;
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 11h2"> Service Administration through a Web Browser </a> </h2>The Internet Service Manager (HTML version) program provides functionality equivalent to Internet Service Manager. Using the HTML version of Internet Service Manager with your Internet browser, you can administer Internet Information Servers across the Internet. For more information see Chapter 3, &#147;<a href="03_iis.htm">Configuring and Managing Your Internet Information Server</a>.&#148;
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 12h2"> Graphical Tool for Creating SSL Keys </a> </h2>As part of the process of enabling Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security on your Web server, you generate a key pair and then acquire an SSL certificate. The new Key Manager application (which is installed with the product and located in the Internet Server submenu) simplifies this procedure. For more information see Chapter 5, &#147;<a href="05_iis.htm">Securing Your Site Against Intruders</a>.&#148;
<P><!--Heading 2--><h2><a name="1h1 13h2"> Content Indexing of HTML Pages and Other Documents </a> </h2>Microsoft Index Server for Windows NT Server 4.0 automatically indexes the text of documents on your Web server. Index Server indexes the complete text of HTML pages and other documents, such as those created in Microsoft Office. Microsoft Index Server also indexes OLE document properties (such as author and subject) and HTML tags so that users can search on the contents of these properties and tags.<P>You can create custom query forms to help users quickly and easily find information on your Web site. You can use Index Server to index documents on multiple servers and in multiple languages. Visit the Microsoft Web site to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/search">download Microsoft Index Server</a>.

<h2><a name="7h1 2h2">Customizing Windows or Windows&#160;NT</a></h2>
There are many ways you can customize Windows or Windows&#160;NT to make your computer more 
accessible.
<p>Beginning with Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0, accessibility features are built into Windows. These 
features are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, have moderately impaired 
vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Look up &#147;accessibility&#148; in the Windows Help Index for 
information about installing and using these features.
<p>Many of the features which make Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0 more accessible can be added to 
earlier versions of Microsoft Windows, Windows&#160;NT, and MS-DOS through Access Packs. You can 
download these files by modem, or you can order them on disks from Microsoft.
<p>You can also use Control Panel and other built-in features to adjust the appearance and behavior of 
Windows or Windows&#160;NT to suit varying vision and motor abilities. These include adjusting colors and 
sizes, sound volume, and the behavior of the mouse and keyboard.
<p>Dvorak keyboard layouts make the most frequently typed characters on a keyboard more accessible if you 
have difficulty using the standard &#147;QWERTY&#148; layout. There are three Dvorak layouts: one if you are a 
two-handed user, one if you type with your left hand only, and one if you type with your right hand only. 
You do not need to purchase any special equipment to use these features.
<p>The specific features available, and whether they are built-in or must be obtained separately, depend on 
which operating system you are using.
<p>For full documentation on the accessibility features available in the operating system you are using, obtain 
the appropriate application notes listed below. Accessibility features are also documented in the <i>Microsoft 
Windows&#160;95 Resource Kit </i>and the <i>Microsoft Windows&#160;NT Resource Kit</i>.
<h3>Which Files to Download or Order</h3>
The application notes listed here provide more complete documentation on ways to customize Windows 
and Windows&#160;NT for individuals with disabilities. The Access Packs and Dvorak keyboard layouts are 
add-on utilities available for versions of Windows or Windows&#160;NT where they are not built in.
<p>You can obtain these files by downloading them with your modem, or you can order them on disks by 
phone. Specific information about downloading or ordering these files immediately follows this list of files.
<p>These files include:
<ul>
<li>Application notes providing more complete documentation on ways to customize Windows and 
Windows&#160;NT.
<p>
<li>Access Packs and Dvorak keyboard layouts provide additional features for versions of Windows or 
Windows&#160;NT in which they are not already included.</ul>
