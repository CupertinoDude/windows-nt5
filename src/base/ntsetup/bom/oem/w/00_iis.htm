Welcome to Microsoft&#174; Peer Web Services version 2.0 for the Windows&nbsp;NT&#174; Workstation version 4.0 operating system. With Microsoft Peer Web Services (PWS), you can create a personal Web site on your desktop for low-volume Web publishing. Peer Web Services is ideal for publishing departmental home pages or personal home pages on your company&#146;s intranet. Peer Web Services is integrated into the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation operating system and runs in conjunction with your business applications, so you do not need a separate computer for Web publishing. 
<P>Although Peer Web Services is designed for easy use with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and is intended for small-scale Web publishing, it provides the same services and most of the same features as Microsoft Internet Information Server for Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Internet Information Server is a robust Web server intended for high-volume, dedicated Web publishing. You can develop and test Web applications and scripts on Peer Web Services and then use them on a Web server running Internet Information Server.
<P>Using Peer Web Services, you can develop a Web site that can be used to:
<ul>
<LI> Publish a department home page on your corporate intranet that lists sales records, reports, members of your department, or other departmental documents.
<P>
<LI> Publish personal home pages that describe your interests, both professional and personal.
<P>
<LI> Share documents among members of your workgroup for collaborative projects.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>Peer Web Services also provides other information services and supports a variety of interfaces that you can use to develop other features for your Web site. You can:
<ul>
<LI> Create high performance client-server applications using the Microsoft Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI).
<P>
<LI> Customize the WWW Service by creating ISAPI filter programs that listen to incoming or outgoing requests and automatically perform actions, such as enhanced logging.
<P>
<LI> Run Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications or scripts.
<P>
<LI> Transmit or receive files using the FTP service.
<P>
<LI> Publish archives of information, spanning multiple computers, using the gopher service.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>Peer Web Services includes the following components:
<ul>
<LI> Internet services: WWW, FTP, and gopher.
<P>
<LI> Internet Service Manager, the tool for administering the Internet services.
<P>
<LI> Internet Database Connector, the component for sending queries to databases.
<P>
<LI> Key Manager, the tool for installing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) keys.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>After you have installed the Internet services, we recommend that you start Internet Explorer and browse through the samples and documentation. To start, type <b>http://</b><i><B>computername</b></i><b>/samples</b> in the <b>Address</b> box of Internet Explorer, where <i>computername</i> is the name of your computer.
<P>For current information about PWS, browse our World Wide Web page at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/infoserv">http://www.microsoft.com/infoserv</a>.
<P>
For example, at the Microsoft Web site you can find new features such as 
Microsoft Index Server. Microsoft Index Server automatically indexes the text of documents on your Web server. Index Server indexes the complete text of HTML pages and other documents, such as those created in Microsoft Office. Microsoft Index Server also indexes OLE document properties (such as author and subject) and HTML tags so that users can search on the contents of these properties and tags.<P>You can create custom query forms to help users quickly and easily find information on your Web site. You can use Index Server to index documents on multiple servers and in multiple languages. Visit the Microsoft Web site to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/search">download Microsoft Index Server</a>.

<h2><a name="6h1 1h2">Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0 Accessibility Features</a></h2>Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0 include several accessibility features that provide users who are 
movement or hearing disabled with better access to computers that run Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0. 
These features enable you to change your display, mouse, and keyboard features, as well as use sound to 
help you use Windows most effectively.
<p>For example, if you have trouble using a mouse, you can use the MouseKeys feature, which enables you to 
use the numeric keypad to move the mouse pointer.
<p>To find these features, double-click the Accessibility Options icon in Control Panel. For a more detailed list 
of procedures, look up &#147;accessibility&#148; in the Help Index.
<h3>Accessibility Options Shortcut Keys</h3>
<p>To use Accessibility Options shortcut keys, the shortcut keys must be enabled. For more information, look 
up &#147;accessibility&#148; in the Help Index.

<h2><a name="6h1 2h2">Customizing Windows or Windows&#160;NT</a></h2>
There are many ways you can customize Windows or Windows&#160;NT to make your computer more 
accessible.
<p>Beginning with Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0, accessibility features are built into Windows. These 
features are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, have moderately impaired 
vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Look up &#147;accessibility&#148; in the Windows Help Index for 
information about installing and using these features.
<p>Many of the features which make Windows&#160;95 and Windows&#160;NT 4.0 more accessible can be added to 
earlier versions of Microsoft Windows, Windows&#160;NT, and MS-DOS through Access Packs. You can 
download these files by modem, or you can order them on disks from Microsoft.
<p>You can also use Control Panel and other built-in features to adjust the appearance and behavior of 
Windows or Windows&#160;NT to suit varying vision and motor abilities. These include adjusting colors and 
sizes, sound volume, and the behavior of the mouse and keyboard.
<p>Dvorak keyboard layouts make the most frequently typed characters on a keyboard more accessible if you 
have difficulty using the standard &#147;QWERTY&#148; layout. There are three Dvorak layouts: one if you are a 
two-handed user, one if you type with your left hand only, and one if you type with your right hand only. 
You do not need to purchase any special equipment to use these features.
<p>The specific features available, and whether they are built-in or must be obtained separately, depend on 
which operating system you are using.
<p>For full documentation on the accessibility features available in the operating system you are using, obtain 
the appropriate application notes listed below. Accessibility features are also documented in the <i>Microsoft 
Windows&#160;95 Resource Kit </i>and the <i>Microsoft Windows&#160;NT Resource Kit</i>.
<h3>Which Files to Download or Order</h3>
The application notes listed here provide more complete documentation on ways to customize Windows 
and Windows&#160;NT for individuals with disabilities. The Access Packs and Dvorak keyboard layouts are 
add-on utilities available for versions of Windows or Windows&#160;NT where they are not built in.
<p>You can obtain these files by downloading them with your modem, or you can order them on disks by 
phone. Specific information about downloading or ordering these files immediately follows this list of files.
<p>These files include:
<ul>
<li>Application notes providing more complete documentation on ways to customize Windows and 
Windows&#160;NT.
<p>
<li>Access Packs and Dvorak keyboard layouts provide additional features for versions of Windows or 
Windows&#160;NT in which they are not already included.</ul>
