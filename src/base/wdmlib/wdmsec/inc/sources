# We must disable buffer overflow checks here. The reason is that we are
# producing a static library that is published in the Windows DDK and this LIB
# must not only be available to VC6 users, it must be available to users of
# non-Microsoft compilers.
#
# (In SP1, the *presence* of this flag enables /GS stuff)
# (In .NET, the flag must be present and set to zero to turn it off!)
#
# This is SP1, so turn off /GS by not defining the flag
