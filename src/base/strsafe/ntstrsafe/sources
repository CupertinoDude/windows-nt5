# Disable buffer overflow checks here, as we are producing a static library

# VC6 users, it must be available to users of non-Microsoft compilers.

# (In XPSP1, the *presence* of this flag enables /GS stuff)
# (In .NET, the flag must be present and set to zero to turn it off!)

# This is SP1, so turn off /GS by not declaring the setting
