; This section name's prefix matches 'My_Install_Section' above.

[My_Install_Section.NT.HW]

; The inf should already include a service entry for the device class.
; It'll look something like the line below.  Keep that line in the inf.

[My_HW_AddReg]
;
;  This HW-branch AddReg section adds values to the hardware-branch
;  registry key of the device (under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum).
;
;  "LowerFilters" and "UpperFilters" are special values that indicate
;  to the kernel that one or more filter drivers should be loaded along
;  with the driver for this device.
;
;  You may also include other values here.  These values can be read
;  by the driver.  The 'SampleFilterParam' value is read by the filter.sys
;  sample driver as an example.
