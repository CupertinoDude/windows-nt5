1. the rule on the pagingio resource is that you have to take it exclusive if you are shrinking
the file of if you are wrapping. otherwise you can take it shared. fat just cycles thru 16
resources that it shared with hpfs; initially, we will do the same....later we may change to a
resource per fcb in the same way as rdr1 and ntfs.
