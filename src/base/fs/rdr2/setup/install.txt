1) Copy rdbss.sys and mrxsmb.sys to system32\drivers directory.

2) copy the .ini/.bat files to the directory of your choice from the appropriate
   sub directory SUR/CAIRO.

3) run setup.bat -- This initializes the registry.

3) Reboot the system. The system will come up with the new rdr. The new rdr will be
active as long as it is correctly loaded / unloaded. If the new redirector
fails the workstation service switches over to the old redirector. In order
to switch over to the new redirector run the following command and reboot
        regini rdr2.ini

NOTE: Under Cairo the reboot is required because DFS keeps the Redirector
device open. Under SUR this in conjunction with net start/stop rdr toggles
between the old and the new one.

4) For CAIRO in order to switch to the old redirector use the following
   commands ..

   regini rdr.ini
   regini rdrdfs.ini

   and reboot.

   Similarly for the new redirector use the following commands

   regini rdr2.ini
   regini rdr2dfs.ini

   and reboot.
