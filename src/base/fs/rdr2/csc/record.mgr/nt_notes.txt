1. i don't get the hint stuff at all.

2. metamatch just seems to be a basic enumeration capability....somehow, it seems that it was originally tied
   into the ifsmgr's metamatch stuff. so far, i haven't needed it.

3. there are numerous issues that are solved by having the correct critical section. i need to be making sure
   that i take it. there should be asserts all over the place about it.
