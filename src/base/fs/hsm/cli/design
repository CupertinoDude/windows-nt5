1. Parse the first the 2 commands:
(i.e. ADMIN SHOW
      VOLUME MANAGE 
      etc.) Translate the 2 keywords into appropriate subinterface.

2. Next: 
   take the rest of the commandline,
   and separate the switches from the regular arguments.

   Compile the switches into a list of 2 LPWSTRS:
         1. Switch itself.
         2. Argument to the switch (supplied by a colon separator)

   Compile the regular arguments into another array

   While compiling these - if double quotes appear, the string that is supplied
   should be considered as one token delimted by a matching double quote.
   Double quotes should be removed however when compiling it into the array.

3. Now validate the switches (duplicates should not be provided,
   arguments should be supplied etc.)

4. Now call the appropriate subinterface with the list of switches
   and the list of arguments.

5.
