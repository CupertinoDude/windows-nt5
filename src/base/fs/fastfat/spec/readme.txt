This directory archives historical documentation from the Windows 9x team
that was retrieved before the group disbanded.  Thanks to BillKru, PeteS
and AaronR.

As new stuff is created it should be archived here too, but the originals
should remain visible.

fat32.doc		A brief overview of FAT32 changes from 1996.
fatgen102-efi.doc	AaronR's original treatise on FAT as he wrote up
			  for the EFI initiative.  This is a near
			  specification of FAT up to FAT32 minus long names.
fatgen103-efi.doc	DanLo's update to include LFN, again for EFI.  This
			  will probably serve as the basis for a future
			  non-EFI encumbered spec.  The LFN material is
			  lifted off of lfnmedia-ext.doc with minor edits.
lfnmedia-ext.doc	An edited version of lfnmedia.doc, removing DOS
			  API specific sections and removing codenames.  It
			  is a standalone LFN specification (for externals).
lfnmedia.doc		BillKru and Russ Arun's LFN specification from 1994.
lfnmed_2.doc		An addendeum to lfnmedia.doc that talks about some
			  specific utility issues LFNs created.
lfnpaper.doc		Talks about Win95 filesystem changes, primarily but
			  not exclusively about LFNs. 
shortname.doc		A description of the RtlGenerate8dot3 algorithim for
			  those inevitable questions.
