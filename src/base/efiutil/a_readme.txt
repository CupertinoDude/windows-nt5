NOTE WELL

This directory (efiutil) contains sources of programs
and related materials Microsoft provides to the "EFI group"
for distribution with the "EFI Kit"

NO MS CRITICAL IP SHOULD BE CHECKED INTO THIS DIRECTORY.

These sources build and run in EFI mode, which is NOT
something that exists on NT except in an emulator.
This directory should never be part of a normal build,
it is here for safekeeping.

Changes to FAT FS are NOT necessarily to be added to EFI-FS
tools in this directory, since EFI-FS may evolve at a different
(slower) rate than FAT.
