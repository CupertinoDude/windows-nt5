Cluster BVT Test

Files Needed to run the test:
-----------------------------
clusbvt.cmd -- (In test directory of the MCM CD)
bvtenv.cmd  -- (In test directory of the MCM CD)
cluscli.exe -- (In sdk/<arch> directory of the MCM CD)

How to run the clusbvt tests:
-----------------------------
The clusbvt.cmd tests should be run after the following
are done.

(a) The cluster service should be up and running on BOTH
the nodes.

(b) Copy all needed files to a directory on the node which
the tests will be run.

(c) Edit the bvtenv.cmd. It explains the parameters to be
set which include name of the cluster etc.

(d) Run clusbvt. ( Clusbvt uses the environment set in
bvtenv.cmd to run the tests. )
