Cluster Administrator Sanity Test --

This test is designed to help verify that a cluster has been
installed correctly and is behaving properly.

The test should be run on a working node in the cluster.

To run the test you will need the following files..

castest.bat -- (In test directory of the MCM CD)
cluadms.pcd -- (In test directory of the MCM CD)
english.dat -- (In test directory of the MCM CD)
mtrun.exe   -- (In test/<arch> directory of the MCM CD)
mstest40.dll-- (In test/<arch> directory of the MCM CD)
msvcrt40.dll-- (In test/<arch> directory of the MCM CD)
ntlog.dll   -- (In test/<arch> directory of the MCM CD)

To run the test copy the above files to a directory on one of
the nodes and type "castest"

The test will launch the Cluster Administrator and run though
some basic tests.  Do not use the mouse or keyboard while the
test is running.  When the test is completed results will be
written to a text file called cluadms.log.
