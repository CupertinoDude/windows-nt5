    This file was adapted from the dummy resource DLL in \nt\private\cluster\resdll\dummy.
    It builds a dummy version of iisclus3.dll which is to be installed on UPGRADE
    from NT 4.0 to NT 5.0. Sooner or later is will become obsolete due to the
    availability of a IIS Virtual Root resource DLL that works with IIS 5.

NOTE:   Commented description of this file is in \nt\bak\bin\sources.tpl
