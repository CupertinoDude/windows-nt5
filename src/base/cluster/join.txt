The FM cannot init groups/resources until the API is online.

The DM expects FM Phase1 init to create the quorum resource.

What happens if remote node goes down at various points along this path?

Order of events is...

Phase 1:
    Petition Other Node to Join

    NmJoin happens

    DmJoin happens
        - Registers with the gum and syncs database

    ApiInitPhase 1
        - Read-only access allowed to DM after this point


    FmInitPhase1
        - Performs synchronized join with GUM layer
        - Must build the quorum resource for DM layer below
            - Builds skeletal groups/resources (especially quorum resource)
        - Gets current state (owner and state) about all groups/resources

 	DmUpdateJoin
		-  hooks in callbacks for quorum notification and node events.

    NmJoinComplete
        - The node is now fully online

Phase 2:
    ApiInitPhase2
        - API is now fully online

    FmInitPhase2
        - Complete building all Groups/Resources
        - Setup all state info retrieved from FmInitPhase1
        - FM is now officially online
        - Pull all groups that should be run on the local node
        - Signal events for all groups/resources


FORM
Phase 1

	DmForm -
		- Registers with gum.

	FmGetQuorumResource
		- gets the quorum resource and arbitrates for it.

	DmUpdateFormNewCluter-
		hooks in callbacks for quorum notifications,node events. This must
		be done before FmInitPhase1.

    FmInitPhase1
        - Performs synchronized join with GUM layer
        - Must build the quorum resource for DM layer below
            - Builds skeletal groups/resources (especially quorum resource)
        - Gets current state (owner and state) about all groups/resources

    DmRollChanges
        - quorum resource is brought online
		- dm layer waits on notification, and when online, 
			changes in the quorum logs are applied.. for logging purposes.
		- Must be done after FmInitPhase1.

Problem:

    - if a node crashes after FmInitPhase1 but before FmInitPhase2 then the
      state info retrieved in Phase1 is stale

	- Resources must be cleaned  appropriately no matter where the failure occurs.

	- A join must convert to form appropriately.
