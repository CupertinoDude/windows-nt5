Tue 14-Jun-96   (V-rogerl)

fpw32\tran\mips\powm.s
	YAPF (Yet Another Pow Fix) BBT found branch to delay slot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 13-Jun-96   (V-rogerl)

fpw32\tran\mips\powm.s
	subu in Lnormal should be dsubu.  Regression only occurs
	on MIPS 4600 processor for some strange reason.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 11-Jun-96	(JamesMa)

crtw32\dllstuff\crtlib.c
	Changed "MSVCRT40.DLL" to "MSVCRT.DLL" (Speed 8607).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 10-Jun-96	(GregF)

crtw32\misc\aw_env.c
        If/when __crtGetEnvironmentStringsA is called a 2nd time, two local
        pointers are not initialized before they are tested against NULL. 
        This is closely related to SPEED 7885 (actually, it's the same bug, 
        but the circumstances under which symptoms will manifest are quite
        different in Win32s). I fixed the bug by initializing the two local
        pointers to NULL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 06-Jun-96	(v-KimPe)

srcrel\pd-b, libw32\msvcrt.src
fpw32\tran\lsources, sources.nt
fpw32\tran\alpha\*.s (all of them)
	Updated ALPHA floating point to latest Digital math library to
	fix some bugs (Speed 7763) (ntraid 37629 and 40953) and to add
	the MIPS API for single precision math routines (e.g. sinf and cosf)
	and the API for fast (and less precise) double routines (F_sin and F_cos).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 06-Jun-96	(JamesMa)

crtw32\h\math.h, libw32\include\math.h
	Added pow(int,int) specialization (Speed 8371).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 05-Jun-96	(JamesMa)

Numerous routines and operators in the ANSI C++ libs were not being
declared as __cdecl, effectively breaking /Gr and /Gz compilations
(Speed 6353). The affected files:

crtw32\stdhpp\exception, fstream, xlocale, xlocnum, xstddef, xstring
crtw32\stdcpp\delop.cpp, fiopen.cpp, locale.cpp, locale0.cpp, newop.cpp,
	newop2.cpp, nomemory.cpp, string.cpp, uncaught.cpp, wlocale.cpp,
	xlocale.cpp
crtw32\h\wchar.h
libw32\include\wchar.h

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 05-Jun-96	(GregF)

crtw32\h\setlocal.h
libw32\msvcrt.src
        Plauger's C++ libs use __lc_handle and __lc_codepage which were not 
        being exported properly from msvcrt.dll. This was the cause of SPEED
        bug #8006. I marked the decls for these two as _CRTIMP in setlocal.h.
        I marked them as DATA (along with four other variables added to the 
        def file at the same time) in msvcrt.src. Voila, another bug bites 
        the dust!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fri 31-May-96	(SteveSa)

crtw32\lowio\open.c
crtw32\lowio\pipe.c
	Fixed two expression errors of the form "(x & FLAG == 0)" wherein
	what was intended was "((x & FLAG) == 0)".  The original expression
	was interpreted as "(x & (FLAG == 0))", which was not correct.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 30-May-96	(SteveSa)

makefile
makefile.inc
crtw32\eh\lsources
crtw32\eh\oldexcpt.cpp  (new file!)
crtw32\eh\oldexcpt.h  (new file!)
libw32\msvcrt40.src
srcrel\makefile
srcrel\objects.mkf
srcrel\pd-b
	To properly support the old MSVC 4.0/4.1 C++ class "logic_error"
	in the forwarder DLL (msvcrt40.dll), we have to compile the file
	stdexcept.cpp file using the v4.1 semantics, and then we put that
	object in msvcirt{,d}.dll and export the set of relevant symbols.
	The files stdexcpt.cpp and stdexcpt.h were modified to support
	the old v4.1 semantics and renamed oldexcpt.* for this purpose.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 30-May-96	(JamesMa)

fpw32\tran\i386\testfdiv.c
	No longer loops through affinity mask; instead, uses MarkL's new
	IsProcessorFeaturePresent() API if possible, only tests 1st processor
	if not.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 29-May-96	(JamesMa)

crtw32\stdhpp\new
	All flavors of operators new & delete are now __cdecl (Speed 6353)
crtw32\stdhpp\stl.h
	Multiset template now uses key's allocator (bug reported by JonCaves).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 29-May-96	(GregF)

crtw32\exec\dospawn.c
crtw32\h\msdos.h
crtw32\lowio\dup.c, dup2.c, ioinit.c, open.c, pipe.c

        Work-around for a nasty bug in NT. If one calls GetFileType on a pipe
        handle, and there is a "blocking read" pending on that pipe, the
        GetFileType never returns. Email I received from Ken Peery and Darryl
        Havens made it clear NT isn't going to fix this (or even admit it's 
        bug).

        I introduced FNOINHERIT, to tag non-inheritable handles, and changed
        the spawn code to NOT pass info on such handles to the child process. 
        This eliminated the main reason for using GetFileType in that startup
        code. Then, I changed the startup code to NOT call GetFileType when 
        the inherited handle was tagged as being a pipe. For 5.0, I intend to
        stop calling GetFileType on inherited file handles altogether!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Sat 25-May-96	(V-rogerl)

crtw32\eh\mips\rtlmisc.s

	Restore extended context exclusively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fri 24-May-96	(BryanT)

crtw32\helper\ppc\icall.s
crtw32\helper\lsources
crtw32\helper\sources.nt

        Add more PPC helper routines (from ChuckL)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 22-May-96	(V-rogerl)

fpw32\tran\mips\ieee.c

	Changed _clearfp() to return old status word versus new one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 22-May-96	(GregF)

crtw32\heap\sbheap.c
        Fixed very nasty typo in __sbh_resize_block. The conditional clause
        of a for statement had an = instead of an == ...major oops! Probably
        the cause of the problems the IDE was seeing (they use realloc a lot
        I believe).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 21-May-96	(SteveSa)

makefile -
	Change base addresses for MSVCRT{,D}.DLL, MSVCRT40.DLL,
	MSVCIRT{,D}.DLL, and MSVCP42{,D}.DLL per BryanT's suggestions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 20-May-96	(GregF)

crtw32\startup\dllcrt0.c
crtw32\dllstuff\crtdll.c, crtlib.c
        Changed the way a failure is handled during the initialization we do
        upon process attach notification. The __proc_attached flag is now set
        to indicate successful completion of initialization. This fixes
        several minor problems including a bug reported by NT about our mis-
        handling of the case where the user's DllMain returns failure upon
        process attach notification.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 15-May-96	(BryanT)

crtw32\h\stdlib.h, libw32\include\stdlib.h
        Add POSIX wrappers for environ definitions

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 15-May-96	(JamesMa)

crtw32\h\math.h, libw32\include\math.h
	Minor fix to remove a C4244 warning from the Pow_int template.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 14-May-96	(JamesMa)

crtw32\stdcpp\xstrcoll.c
	Bug fix to _Strcoll(): error path failed to unlock properly.
crtw32\stdhpp\*
	Added pack(push,8) and pack(pop) pragmas to ANSI headers (Speed 7746).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 14-May-96	(SteveSa)

	Further changes to better support the forwarder DLL (MSVCRT40.DLL).
	The exported data (variables as opposed to functions) forwarded by
	the DLL must be described to the librarian (LINK -LIB) when building
	the exports file (MSVCRT40.EXP).  The new dummy object imp_data.obj
	declares all of the exported data as global uninitialized data.
	That object is only passed to the LINK -LIB step, not the step that
	actually builds the DLL (a LINK step).

crtw32/dllstuff/imp_data.c - new file!
libw32/msvcrt40.src - Removed _imp_ prefix from all entries
makefile - fix the way we build the forwarder DLL
makefile.inc
srcrel/pd-b - pick up new file

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 13-May-96	(BryanT)

crtw32\convert\xtow.c and wtox.c

        Fix _NTSUBSET_ variant so we can export these from ntdll for OLE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 13-May-96	(SteveSa)

	Various changes to better support the forwarder DLL (MSVCRT40.DLL).
	It *MUST* have actual imports from both MSVCRT.DLL and MSVCIRT.DLL.
	I also set up a DllMain for MSVCIRT.DLL and a dummy variable which
	is exported, providing something for MSVCRT40.DLL to import.  The
	forwarder DLL is apparently not fully correct yet, however.

crtw32/dllstuff/fwdr_dll.c - new file!
crtw32/dllstuff/ios_dll.c - new file!
libw32/msvcrt40.src - minor change
makefile
makefile.inc
srcrel/pd-b - pick up new files (not only my 2, but some MIPS FP tests)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 08-May-96   (V-dougme)

crtw32\helper\mips\llcvt.s
		   lldivrem.s

	First step at eradicating odd FP register usage in preparation for
	moving to 32 64-bit floating point register model for MIPS3 (NT40).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 08-May-96   (V-rogerl)

srcrel\mkfiles.sed
srcrel\mkdirs.sed

	Add mips\tests, mips\tests\perf_tests, and mips2.
	Don't copy these directories/files anywhere.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 07-May-96   (V-rogerl)

fpw32\tran\mips\asincosm.s
		atanm.s
		cabsm.s
		coshm.s
		dtoul.s
		expm.s
		fatan.s
		fexp.s
		floorm.s
		fmodm.s
		hypotm.s
		logm.s
		powm.s
		sinhm.s
		sqrtm.s
		tanhm.s
		trigm.s

	First step at eradicating odd FP register usage in preparation for
	moving to 32 64-bit floating point register model for MIPS3 (NT40).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 06-May-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\h\math.h, libw32\include\math.h
	Inlines are now #ifndef _M_M68K (speed bug #7409).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 06-May-96   (GregF)

crtw32\stdio\output.c
        Removed NT_BUILD so that the NT extensions are now part of the retail
        build. Also, took a stab at fixing a problem with %ws in the printf
        family (NT RAID 37620) which shows up in DBCS locales.

crtw32\misc\dbgheap.c
        Don't include heap.h for WINHEAP builds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 03-May-96   (V-rogerl)

srcrel/pd-b
fpw32\tran\mips\rint.s
	Removed another file that should have never been there:
		fpw32\tran\mips\rint.s

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 02-May-96   (V-rogerl)

srcrel/pd-b
fpw32\tran\mips\sqrt3000.c
fpw32\tran\mips\sqrt4000.c
fpw32\tran\mips\xsqrt.s
	Removed files that should have never been there:
		fpw32\tran\mips\sqrt3000.c
		fpw32\tran\mips\sqrt4000.c
		fpw32\tran\mips\xsqrt.s

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 02-May-96   (SteveSa)

crtw32/h/mtdll.h
crtw32/misc/setlocal.c
libw32/msvcrt.src
	The ANSI Std C++ DLL (msvcp42.dll) requires the use of the locale
	locaking variables __setlc_active and __unguarded_readlc_active,
	which are located in MSVCRT.DLL and must be exported from there.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 01-May-96	(SteveSa)

log.txt
makefile
libw32/msvcrt40.rc -- NEW FILE!
libw32/msvcrt40.src -- NEW FILE!
srcrel/pd-b
srcrel/mkclnmkf.c
srcrel/objects.mkf
srcrel/pd-b
srcrel/relmkf.sed
	Added code to produce "forwarder" DLLs named MSVCRT40.DLL and
	MSVCR40D.DLL which will forward all of their symbols to the
	DLLs named MSVCRT.DLL and MSVCRTD.DLL, respectively.  This way
	apps built with MSVC++ v4.0 and v4.1 will get the benefits of the
	much faster heap (as well as other bug fixes) in Visual C++ v4.2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 30-Apr-96   (GregF)

crtw32\heap\heapchk.c
        _heapset() is obsolete and I turned it into a simple call to
        _heapchk(). The originally intended functionality was neither well-
        defined nor useful on Win32 platforms. This fixes Speed 2134 (which
        says it didn't work on Win95 anyway).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 29-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

2 minor bug fixes:
crtw32\misc\dbgrpt.c
	_crtAsssertBusy was being decremented prematurely in _CrtDbgReport().
crtw32\stdhpp\yvals.h
	_FPOSOFF now only #ifndef _FPOS_T_DEFINED, for stdio.h compatibility.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 25-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\stdhpp\iomanip, crtw32\stdcpp\iomanip.cpp
	setiosflags(), resetiosflags(), setbase(), setprecision() &
	setw() are now all __cdecl.
crtw32\heap\calloc.c, free.c, heapinit.c, malloc.c, msize.c, realloc.c
	Backed out Bryant's "Fix POSIX variant" changes to crtw32\heap,
	which had some errant preprocessor directives.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 24-Apr-96   (BryanT)

crtw32\heap\calloc.c, free.c, heapinit.c, malloc.c, msize.c, realloc.c
       Fix POSIX variant

crtw32\convert\*.c
crtw32\h\wchar.h, tchar.h, stdlib.h
libw32\msvcrt.src
    Fix POSIX build and add __int64 variants

crtw32\h\setjmp*.h
crtw32\misc\mips\setjmp*.s
libw32\lib\msvcrt.src
    V5 MIPS (and NT 4.0) defines a faster setjmp (setjmpVfp).

crtw32\string\mips\memorym.s
    Fast qword copy routines

libw32\lib\dirs, sources.nt, dll40\sources, dll40\crt40.*
    Check in changes from NT to build msvcrt40 forwarder dll.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 24-Apr-96   (GregF)

crtw32\heap\hpaort.c
        My changes of yesterday broke the build on this file. Oops. To fix, I
        removed the #include <heap.h>. This header is now obsolete, and never
        was necessary in this particular source.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 23-Apr-96   (GregF)

crtw32\dllstuff\crtlib.c
crtw32\h\cmsgs.h, internal.h, rterr.h
crtw32\heap\heapinit.c
crtw32\startup\crt0.c, crt0msg.c, dllcrt0.c
        Changed _heap_init to return a success/failure code. Changed the
        startups to check it. Added a RTE for the .EXE startup. During this,
        I discovered _NMSG_WRITE wouldn't work if the lowio initialization
        code hadn't been called, so I fixed this as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 22-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\misc\dbgrpt.c
	MAX_MSG increased from 512 to 4096 characters (Speed bug 6849).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fri 19-Apr-96   (GregF)

crtw32\stdcpp\_tolower,c, _toupper.c, xmbtowc.c, xstrcoll.c, xstrxfrm.c,
              xcwscoll.c, xwcsxfrm.c, xwctomb.c
        Revised to use the current scheme of multi-thread locking for
        locale data. Also, many cosmetic changes to make the code more
        readable and the formatting consistent with our own.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 18-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\h\stdio.h
	Inline definitions of getwchar(), putwchar, getwc() & putwc() removed.
crtw32\stdhpp
	Ubiquitous "_T"s replaced by "_TYPE" in 25 files, to prevent conflict
	with tchar.h's _T macro.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 17-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\misc\dbgheap.c, crtw32\h\dbgint.h
	_CrtSetDbgBlockType() is now _CRTIMP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 16-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\h\useoldio.h
libw32\include\useoldio.h
crtw32\stdhpp\use_ansi.h
	New files consisting of various '#pragma comment(lib,...)'s.
crtw32\h\fstream.h, iomanip.h, ios.h, iostream.h, istream.h,
		ostream.h, stdiostr.h, streamb.h, strstrea.h
libw32\include\fstream.h, iomanip.h, ios.h, iostream.h, istream.h,
		ostream.h, stdiostr.h, streamb.h, strstrea.h
	Added '#include <useoldio.h>', removed '#pragma comment(lib,"cirt")'
crtw32\stdhpp\yvals.h
	Removed '#pragma comment(lib,"cprt")'
crtw32\stdhpp\* (ALL but new, exception, xstddef, xlocinfo.h & yvals.h)
	Added '#include <use_ansi.h>'
srcrel\pd-b
	Added useoldio.h, use_ansi.h
crtw32\tools\win32\relinc.cmd
	Added useoldio.h
makefile
	Added -nodefaultlib directives to link response files for
	ANSI C++ & old iostreams dlls
doc\copycrt.bat
	Added old iostream libs/dlls

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 15-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\h\fstream.h, iomanip.h, ios.h, iostream.h, istream.h,
		ostream.h, stdiostr.h, streamb.h, strstrea.h
libw32\include\fstream.h, iomanip.h, ios.h, iostream.h, istream.h,
		ostream.h, stdiostr.h, streamb.h, strstrea.h
	Added '#pragma comment(lib,"cirt")', removed #ifndef _OLD_IOSTREAMS

crtw32\stdhpp\yvals.h
	Added '#pragma comment(lib,"cprt")'

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 15-Apr-96   (JamesMa)

Numerous changes to the crtw32\stdcpp and crtw32\stdhpp directories,
incorporating Plauger's 4/8/96 release.

crtw32\stdcpp\locale0.cpp, uncaught.cpp, wiostrea.cpp, xlocale.cpp
crtw32\stdhpp\stl.h
	New files.

crtw32\stdcpp\xtolower.c, xtoupper.c
crtw32\stdhpp\xios, xwctype.h, yxvals.h
	Removed.

crtw32\stdcpp\*, crtw32\stdhpp\*
	Updated, based on Plauger's 4/8/96 release.

crtw32\h\wchar.h, libw32\include\wchar.h
	Added Wint_t typedef.

crtw32\makefile.inc, srcrel\pd-b
	Updated to reflect above additions and deletions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 11-Apr-96   (GregF)

crtw32\heap\sbheap.c
crtw32\h\winheap.c
        Several optimizations (see revision history comments in sbheap.c).

crtw32\heap\expand.c, free.c, msize.c, realloc.c
        Return type of __sbh_find_block, and the 3rd arg types of
        __sbh_free_block and __sbh_resize_block, all changed to __map_t * (a
        result of the optimizations to sbheap.c).

crtw32\misc\dbgheap.c
        _CrtIsValidHeapPointer was changed to return failure when passed a
        pointer to a free block in the small-block heap.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 04-Apr-96   (GregF)

crtw32\heap\sbheap.c
        Two bug fixes courtesy of Steve Wood. First, in __sbh_release_region,
        I had a reference to the region descriptor *after* is had been freed.
        Second, in __sbh_decommit_pages, I was not updating the global count
        of decommitable pages.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 03-Apr-96   (SteveSa)

makefile
makefile.inc
srcrel\mkdirs.sed
srcrel\mkfiles.sed
srcrel\pd-b
	Changes to support building the old IOSTREAMS as a separate library.
	The DLL models are not yet built because of DLL model problems.

The following files were renamed to work around conflicts with the new
standard C++ library files of the same names:

crtw32\iostream\ios.cpp --> _ios.cpp
crtw32\iostream\iostream.cpp --> _iostream.cpp
crtw32\iostream\strstrea.cpp --> _strstre.cpp

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 28-Mar-96   (GregF)

crtw32\dos\fullpath.c
        Fixed potential memory leak (Speed bug 5818). Detab-ed. Also, cleaned
        up the Mac version formatting and changed ismbcscode to __ismbcscode.

crtw32\lowio\mktemp.c
        Detab-ed. Also, changed ismbcscode to __ismbcscode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 26-Mar-96   (GregF)

crtw32\misc\dbgheap.c
        Added support for small block heap (should have been part of
        yesterday's checkin).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 25-Mar-96   (GregF)

makefile.inc

crtw32\h\malloc.h, winheap.h

crtw32\heap\calloc.c, expand.c, free.c, heapchk.c, heapinit.c, heapmin.c,
            malloc.c, msize.c, realloc.c, sbheap.c (new file)

libw32\msvcrt.src

libw32\include\malloc.h

srcrel\pd-b

        Small-block heap. Core code is in sbheap.c, with most of the new
        types and constants being in winheap.h.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fri 22-Mar-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\stdhpp\xutility - min & max templates renamed to _cpp_min, _cpp_max.
crtw32\stdhpp\new - set_new_handler() now _CRTIMP.
crtw32\stdhpp\yvals.h - true & false now if !defined(...).
crtw32\stdhpp\xlocale - various occurrences of _M1 & _M2 replaced with
	_M01 and _M02.
crtw32\stdhpp\algorithm, deque, limits, list, map, vector, xmemory - various
	occurrences of _T replaced with _TYPE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fri 22-Mar-96   (GregF)

crtw32\time\tzset.c
        Clear _dstbias when there is no DST. In NT 3.51, and maybe other
        builds, GetTimeZoneInformation will return TIME_ZONE_ID_DAYLIGHT
        if automatic DST adjustment is shut off in the control panel. This
        leads to a bug in the CRT's time() function (Speed bug 5252).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 19-Mar-96   (JamesMa)

crtw32\h\math.h - bug fix in _Pow_int template.

crtw32\dllstuff\crtlib.c
crtw32\h\stdlib.h
libw32\msvcrt.src
libw32\include\stdlib.h
	Fix declaration and definition of global variable "_fileinfo" so that
	it works with the /MD models.  In VC++ v4.0/4.1 the variable is not
	declared at all for the /MD and /MDd models.

crtw32\exec\cenvarg.c - now calls __crtGetEnvironmentStringsA() as needed;
	frees env. buffers on exit.
crtw32\h\math.h, libw32\include\math.h - #ifdef __cplusplus no longer
	ifstripped out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 05-Mar-96   (SteveSa)

makefile -
	Add crtw32/stdcpp to list of target directories in which to build

makefile.inc
	Add "stdcpp.lib" to list of targets, and define its constituent OBJs.

makefile.sub
	Add -I../stdhpp to the options when compiling C++ sources.
	This picks up the new C++ header files when compiling C++ files.

crtw32/stdcpp/_tolower.c
crtw32/stdcpp/_toupper.c
crtw32/stdcpp/xmbtowc.c
crtw32/stdcpp/xstrcoll.c
crtw32/stdcpp/xstrxfrm.c
crtw32/stdcpp/xwcscoll.c
crtw32/stdcpp/xwcsxfrm.c
crtw32/stdcpp/xwctomb.c -
	Various edits to fix problems with multi-threaded support and so on.

crtw32/stdhpp/typeinfo
	Add _CRTIMP to the base class upon which exception is defined.
	Since exception itself is _CRTIMP, what it is based upon must also be.

srcrel/pd-b -
	updated to include recently added files

srcrel/msvc40.if -
	Added new symbols mentioned in new and changed header files

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 04-Mar-96   (JamesMa)

The following headers were modified to incorporate PlumHall work:
	stdexcpt.h, new.h, ctype.h, wchar.h, stdio.h

The following headers were modified to simply include the corresponding
PlumHall header, #ifndef _OLD_IOSTREAMS:
	fstream.h, iomanip.h, ios.h, iostream.h, istream.h, ostream.h,
	streambuf.h, strstrea.h

The following header was essentially removed - the whole body is now
#ifdef _OLD_IOSTREAMS:
	stdiostr.h

The PlumHall header file EXCEPTION was modified to remove material duplicated
in eh.h.

Also, time\strftime.c was modified to incorporate PlumHall locale work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 28-Feb-96   (SteveSa)

srcrel/pd-b
	Brought up to date with v4.2 project

srcrel/makefile
	Modified to allow automated regeneration of srcrel/pd-b

srcrel/mkclnmkf.c
	Support added to copy crtw32/stdcpp and crtw32/stdhpp directories.

srcrel/mkfiles.sed
	Ignore files of the form *.scc when cleansing/copying sources

Also, five header files in the crtw32/stdhpp directory were deleted because
they were modified versions of files already in crtw32/h.  These were math.h,
stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, and wchar.h.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 28-Feb-96   (SteveSa)

crtw32/stdcpp/* - new directory and files
crtw32/stdhpp/* - new directory and files

Add new directories crtw32/stdcpp and crtw32/stdhpp which contain the new
Standard C++ source files and header files, respectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 21-Feb-96   (SteveSa)

log_v41.txt
crtw32\misc\dbgheap.c
	Propogated from the v4.1 tree (last minute bug fix)
	Protected call to HeapValidate() in _CrtIsValidHeapPtr() so
	that it is only made on Windows NT.  HeapValidate() is NOT
	supported on Windows 95 or Win32s.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tue 19-Feb-96   (SteveSa)

crtw32/startup/stdenvp.c -
	Global pointer _aenvptr/_wenvptr is set to NULL after the block
	to which it points (a copy of the environment strings) is freed.

srcrel/_sample_.rc
	Some edits to make this file more closely match libw32/msvcrt.rc

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 18-Feb-96   (SteveSa)

log_v41.txt
crtw32\lowio\osfinfo.c
	propogated from the v4.1 tree (last minute bug fix)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thu 15-Feb-96	(SteveSa)

log.txt -> log_v41.txt
	Renamed old LOG.TXT from V4.1 and started a new LOG.TXT (this file).

Then I made two major changes:

1) renamed the output DLLs:
	MSVCRT40.DLL to MSVCRT.DLL
and	MSVCR40D.DLL to MSVCRTD.DLL

2) removed IOSTREAMS from the libraries

To accomplish this, I renamed the following source files (contents unchanged):

crtw32/dllstuff/macdll/
	msvcrt40.def -> msvcrt.def
	msvcrt40.r   -> mscvrt.r
	msvcr40d.def -> msvcrtd.def

libw32/
	msvcrt40.rc  -> msvcrt.rc

Files modified:

	libw32/msvcrt.src
	makefile
	makefile.inc
	srcrel/external.mkf
	srcrel/mkclnmkf.c
	srcrel/mkdirs.sed
	srcrel/mkfiles.sed
	srcrel/objects.mkf
	srcrel/pd-b
