We never have built OLECLI.DLL for WOW.

Until NT 5, we just distributed the Win 3.1 version.

On NT 5, we distribute the Win '98 version.

The difficulty is that nobody seems to know how this gets built,
from what sources it was built, or the tools used to build it -- 
not even the Win'98 folks who built the Win'98 version (scary huh?).

So for now the Win '98 binary is just checked into the 
private\mvdm\bin86 dir with the respective FE Win '98 versions.
