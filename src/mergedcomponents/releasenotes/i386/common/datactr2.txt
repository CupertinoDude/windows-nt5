======================================================================
6.0   Planning Disk Partitions
======================================================================

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be
formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C and 
D). A primary partition, or system partition, is one on which you 
can install the files needed to load an operating system, such as
Whistler.

Important: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, 
be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand because these actions 
will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk 
contents, you should back up the entire contents of the hard disk 
before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more 
of your partitions alone.

Do not install Whistler on a compressed drive unless the partition
was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.
Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Whistler
Setup on it.

Before running Setup to perform a new installation, you will need to
determine the size of the partition on which to install Whistler
Datacenter Server. There is no set formula for figuring a partition
size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating
system, applications, or other files that you might group together
on the installation partition. The files for setting up Whistler
Datacenter Server require at least 1 GB of free space on the disk, as
described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text file series.
You should allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. 
It is not unreasonable to allow 2-4 GB on the partition for medium 
installations, and as much as 10 GB for larger installations. 
This allows space for a variety of items, including optional
components, user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future
service packs, the pagefile used by the operating system, and other
items.

When you perform a new installation of Whistler Datacenter Server,
you can select the partition on which to install. If you specify a
partition on which another operating system exists, you will be
prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Whistler. After Whistler is installed, you can use Disk
Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes
creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming,
and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks;
and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic
to basic. 

6.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
======================================================================

If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server (so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers), you will
need a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services.
Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single
Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services. If you need to
create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing
it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you
can create it (you should allow 2 GB of space, but you might need 
less, depending on how the server will be used). Alternatively, for 
the system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk.

For information about Remote Installation Services and about disk and
partition choices, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

6.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
======================================================================

You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup. After Setup, 
you can modify the partitioning of the disk by using Disk Management.

During the installation process, Setup examines the hard disk to
determine its existing configuration and then offers the following
options:

 * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
   Whistler partition.

 * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
   space, you can create the Whistler partition by using the
   unpartitioned space.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
   you can install Whistler on that partition, with or without
   reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition
   erases all data on the partition. If you don't reformat the
   partition but you do install Whistler where there was already an
   operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
   you will have to re-install any applications you want to use
   with Whistler.

 * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
   create more unpartitioned disk space for the Whistler partition.
   Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that
   partition.

6.3   Computers that Contain Multiple Whistler Partitions
======================================================================

A computer can be set up so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from different installations of Whistler (including Whistler
Professional and any product in the Whistler Server family). If you
want to set up a computer this way, note the following:

 * It is not necessary to create multiple installations of 
   Whistler for insurance against startup difficulties resulting 
   from driver or disk problems. Whistler includes a variety of 
   disaster-recovery features, one of which is safe mode. When 
   started in safe mode, Whistler uses default settings and the 
   minimum number of drivers (ensuring the ability to start even 
   if a new driver is causing a problem). Another recovery feature 
   is the Recovery Console, a command-line interface that you can 
   start from the Setup CD. After starting the Recovery Console 
   and logging on, you can perform tasks such as starting and stopping 
   services and accessing the local drive. For more information about
   disaster recovery, see Whistler Help and Support Services.

 * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
   install the applications used with an operating system on the
   same partition with it. If an application is used with two
   different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

 * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer
   name for each installation. Because a unique security identifier
   (SID) is used for each installation of Whistler on a domain, the
   computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
   multiple installations on the same computer.

 * If you use Encrypting File System (EFS) on a computer
   containing multiple installations of Whistler, the encrypted
   files will not be readable between the different installations
   unless you take one of the following approaches. One approach is
   to ensure that all the installations are in the same domain and
   that the user of these installations has a roaming profile.
   Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
   certificate and associated private key from one installation and
   import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing 
and exporting certificates, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
7.0   Choosing Components to Install
======================================================================

The Whistler Server family of products includes a wide variety of
core components, including a number of administrative tools, that
Setup installs automatically. In addition, you can choose from a
number of optional components that extend the functionality of your
server. You can install these components during Setup, or you can add
them later (through Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel).
Alternatively, after Setup, you can use the Configure Your Server
Wizard, which will choose and install components for you according to
the type of server you specify.

Choosing more of these components means providing more possibilities
on the server. However, you should choose only the components you
need because each component requires additional disk space. The
following table (and the list that follows it) will help you choose
the components you need in your installation.

  e-mail, Web-based authentication, and smart card authentication. 
  For information about authentication of dial-up users, see 
  "Networking Services" later in this list.

Fax Service
  Provides support for the sending and receiving of faxes.

Indexing Service
  Provides indexing functions for documents stored on disk. By using 
  Indexing Service, users can search for specific document text or 
  properties.

Internet Information Services (IIS)
  Provides support for Web-site creation, configuration, and
  management, along with Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), 
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
  (SMTP).

Management and Monitoring Tools
  Provides tools for communications administration, monitoring, 
  and management, including applications that support development of 
  customized client dialers for remote users and implementation of 
  phone books that can be automatically updated from a central server. 
  In addition, Management and Monitoring Tools includes Simple 
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management 
  Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider.

Message Queuing Services
  Provides a communication infrastructure and a development tool for
  creating distributed messaging applications. Such applications can
  communicate across heterogeneous networks and with computers that
  might be offline. Message Queuing Services provide guaranteed 
  message delivery, efficient routing, security, transactional 
  support, and priority-based messaging.

Networking Services
  Provides important support for networks, including the items 
  in the  following list. For information about network monitoring,
  see "Management and Monitoring Tools" earlier in this list. For
  background information about IP addresses and name resolution, see
  "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in 
  this text file series.

   * COM Internet Services Proxy. Supports distributed applications
     that use HTTP to communicate through Internet Information
     Services.

   * DNS. Provides name resolution for clients running Windows 2000
     or Whistler. With name resolution, users can gain access to 
     servers by name instead of having to use IP addresses that are
     difficult to recognize and remember.

   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Gives a server the
     capability of assigning IP addresses dynamically to network
     devices. These devices typically include server and
     workstation computers but can also include other devices
     such as printers and scanners. With DHCP, you do not need to
     set and maintain static IP addresses on any of these
     devices, except for intranet servers providing DHCP, DNS,
     or WINS service.

   * Internet Authentication Service (IAS). Performs authentication,
     authorization, and accounting of dial-up and virtual private
     network (VPN) users. IAS supports the widely used protocol
     called Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).

   * QoS Admission Control Service. Controls how
     applications are allotted network bandwidth. You can give
     important applications more bandwidth, less important
     applications less bandwidth.

   * Simple TCP/IP Services. Supports Character Generator, Daytime
     Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day.

   * Universal Plug and Play. Installs Universal Plug and Play devices 
     so that you can use them immediately, without additional 
     configuration steps.

   * Universal Plug and Play Device Host. Provides support to host
     Universal Plug and Play devices.

   * Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Provides name resolution
     for clients running Windows NT and earlier versions of
     Microsoft operating systems. With name resolution, users can
     gain access to servers by name, instead of having to use IP
     addresses that are difficult to recognize and remember.

Other Network File and Print Services
  Provides file and print services for the Macintosh operating 
  system, as well as print services for UNIX.

Remote Installation Services
  Provides services that you can use to set up new client computers
  remotely, without the need to visit each client. The target clients
  must either support remote startup with the Pre-Boot eXecution
  Environment (PXE) ROM, or else must be started with a remote-start
  floppy disk. On the server, you will need a separate partition for
  Remote Installation Services. For more information, see "Disk
  Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services" earlier in
  this text file series.

Remote Storage
  Provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media
  such as tapes more accessible. Infrequently used data can
  automatically be transferred to tape and retrieved when needed.

Root Certificates Auto Update
  Supports automatic update of the certificate root store.

Terminal Server
  Terminal Server provides the ability to run client applications 
  on the server, while "thin client" software acts as a terminal 
  emulator on the client. Each user sees an individual session, 
  displayed as a Whistler desktop, and each session is managed by 
  the server, independent of any other client session. If you 
  install Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server 
  Licensing on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer 
  on which you install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses 
  can be issued for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server 
  for up to 90 days.

Terminal Server Licensing
  Provides a licensing service that allows you to download, issue, 
  and track licenses for Terminal Server clients. If you install 
  Terminal Server, you must also install Terminal Server Licensing 
  on at least one computer (not necessarily a computer on which you 
  install Terminal Server). However, temporary licenses can be issued 
  for clients that allow you to use Terminal Server for up to 90 days.

To register a license server quickly, install it on a computer that
has Internet access.

During Terminal Server Licensing Setup, you can select from two types
of license server: domain license server (the default) or enterprise
license server. A domain license server can only support Terminal
servers that are in the same domain as the license server. You must
choose a domain license server if the license server is in a workgroup
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain. Regardless of the type of domain, you can
choose a domain license server if you want to maintain a separate
license server for each domain. In Whistler domains, you must install
the domain license server on a domain controller. In workgroups or
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you can install the domain license server on
any server.

You can also choose to install a license server as an enterprise
license server. An enterprise license server can support Terminal
servers in Whistler domains or mixed domains (that is, with some
domain controllers running Whistler and some domain controllers
running Windows NT 4.0). You must choose an enterprise license server
if the license server will support Terminal servers in multiple
Whistler domains.

Windows Media Services (for x86-based computers only)
  Provides multimedia support, allowing you to deliver content using
  Advanced Streaming Format over an intranet or the Internet.


======================================================================
8.0   Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution
======================================================================

TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on your
servers. Setup and the Configure Your Server Wizard are designed to 
make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the services that support it.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily by using DNS and Windows 
Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more 
information.

8.1   IP Addresses
======================================================================

As described in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer, either automatically by
Whistler, dynamically through the DHCP service (which you configure),
or statically (using an IP address that you have obtained).

You can allow Whistler to provide IP addresses automatically during
Setup, and then, after Setup, change your configuration to use DHCP,
static addressing, or both. For more information about DHCP and IP
addressing, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

The following list describes the methods you can use to provide an IP
address:

 * For a limited number of servers (five or fewer) on a small private
   network, you can use the Whistler Datacenter Server feature
   called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to automatically
   assign IP addresses for you. In Setup, automatic addressing is
   available from the Networking Settings dialog box when you
   select the Typical settings option.

 * If your network has more than one subnet, choose one server on
   which to install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) component. The DHCP server will provide IP
   addresses dynamically to other computers. It must itself be
   assigned a static IP address (so other computers can locate it).

   In this situation, in order to support clients, you might also
   need one or more servers with the DNS component, the Windows 
   Internet Name Service (WINS) component, or both. DNS and WINS are
   described in the following section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP." 
   One server or several servers can provide DHCP, DNS, and/or WINS. 
   Any server providing these services should be assigned a static IP 
   address (so other computers can locate it). For detailed 
   information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying 
   Networking Settings" later in this text file series.

 * If a particular server will be directly providing access to users
   on the Internet, you must assign that server a static IP
   address. You can obtain an address and an associated domain name
   from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or from the Internet
   Network Information Center (InterNIC). For more information
   about InterNIC, see:

   http://internic.net/

   If a computer has more than one network adapter, it will need a
   separate IP address for each adapter. For detailed information
   about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying Networking
   Settings" later in this text file series.

After a server is provided with an IP addressing option, the next
components to consider are those that provide for name resolution,
which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users
can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The
following sections describe options for name resolution.

8.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
======================================================================

Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember 
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP 
addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. 
The name-resolution services are DNS and Windows Internet Name Service 
(WINS).

8.2.1   DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers 
on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers 
are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet 
e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is also required in 
domains with clients running Windows 2000 or Whistler. DNS is 
installed automatically when you create a domain controller (or 
promote a server to become a domain controller), unless the Whistler 
software detects that a DNS server already exists for that domain. 
(Alternatively, you can explicitly select DNS as a component to 
install during or after Setup.)

If you are installing DNS on a server, you will need to specify a
static IP address on that server. In addition, you will need to
configure the DNS clients so that they recognize that IP address. For
information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring DNS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open 
Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and 
then click Help and Support.

8.2.2   Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
---------------------------------------------

If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any 
earlier Microsoft operating system, you will need to install 
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the 
domain. WINS is an optional software component and appears under 
Networking Services in the list of installable Windows components. 
(For more information about different ways you can install 
components during or after Setup, see "Choosing Components to 
Install" earlier in this text file series.) If you are installing 
WINS on a server, you will need to specify a static IP address on 
that server. In addition, you will need to configure the WINS 
clients so that they recognize that IP address.

For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Specifying
Networking Settings" later in this text file series. For information
about configuring WINS, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To 
open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, 
and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains
======================================================================

A domain is a grouping of accounts and network resources under a
single domain name and security boundary. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of because a domain has a 
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other 
network details. The information in this database is replicated 
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers 
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You 
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Whistler Help and Support 
Services. To open Help and Support Services, after completing Setup, 
click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
======================================================================

With Whistler, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: domain
controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and
other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) With Whistler, it is possible to
change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to
member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete.
However, you should plan your domain before running Setup and change 
server roles only when necessary.

It is a good idea to give careful thought to the names of your domain
controllers before running Setup. You cannot change the name of a
server while it is a domain controller. Instead, you must change the 
domain controller to a member or stand-alone server, change the name, 
and finally make the server a domain controller once again.

If you have multiple domain controllers, it provides better support
for users than having only one. Multiple domain controllers provide
automatic backup for user accounts and other Active Directory data,
and they work together to support domain controller functions (such as
carrying out logon validations). For more information about domain 
controllers, see the topics under Active Directory in Whistler Help 
and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, after 
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.1.1   Special Aspects of Whistler Domain Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you manage your Whistler domains, you might want to learn more
about operations master roles. This section describes operations
master roles briefly. For more information about operations master 
roles, see Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and 
Support Services, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

Operations master roles are special roles assigned to one or more
domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain
controllers assigned to these roles perform operations that are 
single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network 
at the same time). For example, the creation of security identifiers 
for new resources (such as new computers) must be overseen by a single
domain controller, to ensure that the identifiers are unique.

The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically
assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the
assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases
this will not be necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of
operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master
or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about
operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see
Whistler Help and Support Services. To open Help and Support Services, 
after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

9.2   Additional Information About Domains
======================================================================

For detailed information about domains, operations master roles, and
other domain-related topics, see Active Directory in Whistler Help and 
Support Services. To open Whistler Help and Support Services, after 
you install Whistler on your first server, click Start, and then click 
Help and Support.

For information about setting up multiple domains with structured 
relationships, see the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit, 
Deployment Planning Guide."
