When installing a new operating system, you need to make several
choices. The Windows XP Setup Wizard and these release notes
guide you through these choices.

      Important: Before you begin, you should also read the file
      Read1st.txt, which is on the Windows XP Home Edition CD.
      This file contains late-breaking information that was 
      unavailable when these release notes and the product
      documentation was written, including preinstallation 
      notes vital to the success of your installation.

These release notes describe how to run the Windows XP Setup Wizard
and install Windows XP Home Edition on a single computer.

1.0 Before You Begin
======================================================================

When you set up Windows XP Home Edition, you have to provide
information about how you want to install the operating system. The
procedures in these release notes help you to provide the necessary
information. To ensure a successful installation, complete the
following tasks, which are described in the sections that follow,
before you install Windows XP:

   * Make sure your hardware components meet the minimum requirements.

   * Obtain compatible hardware and software, such as
     upgrade packs and new drivers.

   * Back up your current files in case you need to
     restore your current operating system.

   * Determine whether you want to perform an upgrade or install a new
     copy of Windows XP Home Edition.

1.1 Hardware Requirements
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP Home Edition, make sure your computer 
meets the following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 233 megahertz (MHz) Pentium or higher microprocessor (or 
     equivalent)
   * 128 megabytes (MB) recommended (64 MB of RAM minimum; 
     4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM maximum)
   * 1.5 GB of free space on your hard disk
   * VGA monitor
   * Keyboard
   * Mouse or compatible pointing device 
   * CD-ROM or DVD drive

1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard automatically checks your hardware and 
software and reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful
installation, however, you should determine whether your computer
hardware is compatible with Windows XP Home Edition before you run the
wizard.

You can view the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at the Microsoft
Web site:

http://www.microsoft.com/hcl/

      Important: Windows XP Home Edition supports only those devices 
      listed in the HCL. If your hardware isn't listed, contact 
      the hardware manufacturer and request a Windows XP 
      driver for the component. To ensure that programs using 16-bit 
      drivers function properly afterwards, request 32-bit drivers 
      from the software vendor.

During the setup process, you can use upgrade packs to make your 
existing software compatible with Windows XP Home Edition. Upgrade
packs are available from the appropriate software manufacturers.

1.3 Backing Up Your Files
======================================================================

If you're upgrading from an earlier version of Windows, you should
back up your current files to a disk or a tape drive.

If your computer is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98, you 
may need to install the Windows Backup program. For more information
about installing or using Windows Backup, see your Windows 95 or
Windows 98 Help.

1.4 Upgrading vs. Installing a New Copy
======================================================================

After you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard, one of the first
decisions you have to make is whether to upgrade your current
operating system or perform an entirely new installation (a "clean
install").

During an upgrade, the wizard replaces existing Windows files but 
preserves your existing settings and applications. Some applications 
might not be compatible with Windows XP Home Edition and therefore
might not function properly after an upgrade. You can upgrade to
Windows XP Home Edition from the following operating systems:

   * Windows 98 (all versions)
   * Windows Millennium Edition

If your computer is currently running an unsupported operating 
system, you must install a new copy of Windows XP Home Edition. The
wizard installs Windows XP Home Edition in a new folder. After the
installation is complete, you will have to reinstall applications and
reset your preferences.

You should UPGRADE if all           You should INSTALL a new copy 
of the following are true:          if any of the following are true:

                                    preferences, so that you
                                    can cleanly install. 

If you want to modify the way the wizard installs Windows XP Home
Edition, you can click Advanced Options, and then perform any of the
following tasks:

   * Change the default location of the Setup files.
   * Store system files in a folder other than the default folder
     (\Windows).
   * Copy the installation files from the CD to the hard disk.
   * Select the partition on which to install Windows XP Home Edition.

Unless you're an advanced user, it's recommended that you use the
default settings.

======================================================================
2.0 Running Windows XP Setup 
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard gathers information, including regional 
settings, names, and passwords. The wizard then copies the appropriate

files to your hard disk, checks the hardware, and configures your 
installation. When the installation is complete, you're ready to log
on to Windows XP Home Edition. Note that your computer restarts
several times during the process.

How you start the Windows XP Setup Wizard depends on whether you're 
upgrading or installing a new copy of Windows XP Home Edition.
Determine your installation method, locate the appropriate section in
these release notes, and then follow the procedures for your scenario.

2.1 If You're Installing a New Copy (Clean Install)
======================================================================

If your computer has a blank hard disk or your current operating
system isn't supported, you need to start your computer by using the 
Windows XP Home Edition CD. Some newer CD-ROM drives can start the
installation from the CD and automatically run the Windows XP
Setup Wizard.

>>> To install a new copy by using the CD: 

   1. Start your computer by running your current operating system,
      and then insert the Windows XP Home Edition CD into your CD-ROM 
      drive. 

   2. If Windows automatically detects the CD, click Install Windows. 
      The Windows XP Setup Wizard appears.

      If Windows doesn't automatically detect the CD, click Start,
      and then click Run. Type the path to the setup file, replacing 
      'd' if necessary with the letter of your CD-ROM drive: 
      
      d:\setup.exe 
      
   3. Press ENTER.

   4. When prompted to choose an installation type, select New 
      Installation, and then click Next.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.2 If You're Upgrading
======================================================================

The upgrade process is simple. The Windows XP Setup Wizard detects and
installs the appropriate drivers, or it creates a report listing 
devices that couldn't be upgraded, so you can be sure your hardware 
and software are compatible with Windows XP Home Edition.

>>> To upgrade from the CD: 

   1. Start your computer by running your current operating system,
      and then insert the Windows XP Home Edition CD into your CD-ROM 
      drive. 

   2. If Windows automatically detects the CD, the Windows XP Home 
      Edition CD dialog box appears. To start your upgrade, 
      click Install Windows.

      If Windows doesn't automatically detect the CD, click Start,
      and then click Run. Then type the path to the setup file, 
      replacing 'd' if necessary with the letter of your CD-ROM drive:
      
      
      d:\setup.exe 
      
   3. Press ENTER.

   4. When prompted to choose an installation type, select Upgrade, 
      and then click Next.

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.3 Collecting User and Computer Information
======================================================================

The Windows XP Setup Wizard helps you gather information about you and
your computer. Although much of this installation process is
automatic, you might need to provide information or select settings in
the following screens, depending on the current configuration of your
computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to 
     continue the setup process, select I accept this agreement. 

   * Select a File System. Windows XP Home Edition can automatically 
     convert partitions on your hard disk to NTFS, the recommended 
     file system for Windows XP Home Edition. Or you can choose to 
     keep your existing file systems. If you're upgrading, the wizard 
     uses your current file system.

   * Regional Settings. Change the system and user locale settings
     for different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person and,
     optionally, the organization to whom this copy of Windows XP Home
     Edition is licensed.

   * Computer Name. Type a unique computer name. The wizard suggests a
     computer name, but you can change the name.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you 
     want Windows XP Home Edition to automatically adjust for 
     daylight saving time.

======================================================================
3.0 Starting Windows XP Home Edition
======================================================================

After gathering information, the Windows XP Setup Wizard completes the
installation. Your computer restarts several times, and then 
Windows XP Home Edition prompts you to log on. After you log on, you
can activate and register your copy of Windows XP Home Edition, create
user accounts, and reconfigure any settings that you entered during
the setup process.

      Important: You must have a "computer administrator" user account 
      to activate and register Windows XP Home Edition, as well as to 
      create user accounts and change your computer's settings. 

      To check your account type, click Start, click Control Panel,
      and then click User Accounts.

3.1 Logging on to Windows XP Home Edition
======================================================================

When your computer restarts after installation, log on to 
Windows XP Home Edition for the first time. If you upgraded from an
earlier version of Windows and already have an existing user account, 
you can log on using that account and password.

3.2 Creating a User Account
======================================================================

Your user account identifies your user name and password and your 
personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified 
by a user name and a password, both of which the user types when 
logging on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts 
if you log on using an account that has Administrator rights.

>>> To create a user account: 

   1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel. 

   2. Double-click User Accounts. 

   3. Click Create a new account.

   4. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.
