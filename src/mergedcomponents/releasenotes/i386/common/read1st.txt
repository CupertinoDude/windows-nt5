for your operating system referenced in the readme.htm file on your
Windows XP CD.

======================================================================
3.0 Preinstallation Notes
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP on your computer, be sure to read this
section. This section contains information about issues that affect
the installation process. By using this information to perform your 
installation, you can ensure that the installation process proceeds 
smoothly and that Windows XP functions correctly.

3.1 Windows Product Activation (WPA)
======================================================================

Products: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional only

If you are prompted to activate your installation of Windows XP, defer
activation until you have completed planned upgrades or changes to
your computer's FIXED hardware and their device drivers. Otherwise,
you may need to reactivate after making such changes. FIXED 
hardware/drivers include the first instance of devices such as
video, network (excluding modems), SCSI, hard drives, CD-ROM/DVD, and
system memory. USB or other removable devices (such as cameras and
printers) do not affect activation.

3.2 Using Passwords 
======================================================================

3.2.1 Password Backup Disk
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Products: Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional only

If you created a password backup disk for a previous version of
Windows, this process has changed. Re-create your password backup disk
for Windows XP.

3.2.2 Restrictions on the Use of Blank Passwords
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows XP has a new default security feature that helps protect users
with blank passwords from network-based attacks. Users who do not 
password-protect their accounts can only log on at their physical 
computer console: the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that is physically 
connected to their computer. This restriction only applies to local 
user accounts, not to domain user accounts.

Caution: If your computer is not in a physically secured location, you
should assign strong passwords to all local user accounts. Failure to
do so allows anyone with physical access to the computer to log on
using a user account that does not have a password. This is especially
important for portable computers, which should always have strong
passwords on all local user accounts.

3.3 Software Compatibility Issues 
======================================================================

3.3.1 Message Queuing
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Products: Windows XP Home Edition only

Message Queuing is not supported on Windows XP Home Edition. If you
are upgrading from Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium
Edition computers running MSMQ version 1.0, consider upgrading your
computer to Windows XP Professional.
