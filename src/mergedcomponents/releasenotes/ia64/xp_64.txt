======================================================================
1.0 Before You Begin
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, read this section 
to ensure that your equipment meets the minimum requirements and that 
you have the information you will need during Setup.

1.1 Hardware Requirements
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP, make sure your computer meets the
following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 733 megahertz (MHz) Intel Itanium-based microprocessor

   * 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM (minimum)

   * 6 gigabytes (GB) of free hard disk space (minimum) for Setup

   * VGA monitor or better

   * Keyboard

   * Mouse or compatible pointing device

   * CD-ROM drive

For network installation:

   * Windows XP-compatible network adapter card and related cable

   * Access to the network share that contains the Setup files

1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
======================================================================

Windows XP Setup automatically checks your hardware and software
and reports any potential conflicts. To ensure a successful
installation, however, you should determine whether your computer
hardware is compatible with Windows XP 64-Bit Edition before you 
start Setup. This is particularly important if you are using a 
high-end video card for rendering three-dimensional graphics, or 
if you are using computer peripherals other than the minimum hardware
requirements mentioned in the previous section.

You can view the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at the Microsoft
Web site:

http://www.microsoft.com/hcl

        IMPORTANT: Windows XP 64-Bit Edition supports only those 
        devices listed in the HCL. If your hardware isn't in this 
        list, contact the hardware manufacturer and ask if there's 
        a Windows XP 64-Bit Edition driver for the component. 

During Setup, you can use Dynamic Update to ensure that you are 
getting the most up-to-date Setup files for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.

1.3 Obtaining Network Information
======================================================================

The first step is to decide whether your computer is joining a domain
or a workgroup. If you don't know which option to choose or if your
computer won't be connected to a network, select the workgroup option.
(You can join a domain after you install Windows XP.)

If your computer is currently connected to a network, request
the following information from your network administrator before you
begin the setup process:

   * Name of your computer

   * Name of the workgroup or domain

   * TCP/IP address (if your network does not have a Dynamic Host
     Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server)

To connect to a network during Setup, you must have the correct
hardware installed on your computer and it must be connected by 
a network cable. 

1.4 Disk Partitioning Requirements for Itanium-based Workstations
======================================================================

Itanium-based computers have specific partitioning requirements. Two 
partitions are created automatically when you install Windows XP 
for the first time on your computer.

*  The first partition is a FAT partition of about 100 megabytes (MB).
   Called the EFI System Partition, this partition is used to store 
   programs and information files that the Extensible Firmware 
   Interface (EFI) uses to automatically start Windows XP.

*  The Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition is a 32 MB partition that 
   allows the operating system to perform operations that require 
   dedicated disk space, such as changing a disk from basic to 
   dynamic.

The EFI system partition is the first partition on your hard disk 
and the MSR partition is the second partition. If you are using 
multiple hard disks, the MSR partition is the first partition 
on your second hard disk and all subsequent hard disks. Only one 
EFI system partition is necessary for a computer, and it must be on 
your boot drive.

For information about EFI utilities, see the documentation supplied
by your computer vendor.

        IMPORTANT: The recommended minimum partition size for 
        installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is 6 GB.

======================================================================
2.0 Installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition
======================================================================

Setup for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is divided into two phases. The
first phase is text-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup copies files 
to the computer, checks your hardware, and configures your 
installation. You can also choose to create multiple partitions during
this phase. Your computer will restart at the end of this phase.

The second phase is GUI-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup gathers 
information such as regional settings, user name and password, and 
network information. Your computer restarts again when Setup is 
complete. 

2.1 Installing for the First Time
======================================================================

Setup creates the EFI system partition and the MSR partition 
automatically. It is recommended that you create a single data 
partition of no less than 6 GB for installing the operating system. 

>> To install Windows XP on a clean machine:

   1. Ensure that the hardware for your Itanium-based computer is 
      set up properly and that everything is attached as it should be.

   2. Turn on your computer.

   3. Insert the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition CD into the CD-ROM
      drive.

   4. When prompted in the EFI Boot Manager, boot to the CD-ROM drive.

      When you see "Press any key to boot from CD-ROM...", press a key
      and Windows XP text-mode Setup begins.

      If the CD does not start automatically, boot to the EFI shell, 
      select the CD-ROM drive, and type:

        setupldr

      and then press ENTER.

      Note: Setup can create the EFI system partition and the MSR 
      partition automatically. If you want, you can choose to create 
      the EFI system partition yourself, but it is recommended that 
      you let Setup create this partition.

   5. When prompted to install Windows, determine the size of 
      your data partition. The recommended minimum size for 
      installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is 6 GB. 

   6. Follow the directions that appear. Once GUI-mode setup is 
      complete, the computer restarts automatically. 

2.2 Installing an Updated Version 
======================================================================

Installing a newer version of Windows XP 64-Bit Edition over a 
previous version is simple. Setup detects and installs the appropriate
drivers, or it creates a report on devices that could not be upgraded,
so that you can be sure your hardware and software are compatible with
Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.

>> To update from the CD:

   1. Turn on your computer, and start Windows XP 64-Bit Edition.

   2. Insert the Windows XP 64-bit Edition update CD into your CD-ROM 
      drive. 

      If Windows automatically detects the CD, the Windows XP CD
      dialog box appears. Click Install Windows to start your upgrade.

      Otherwise, click Start, and then click Run. Type the following 
      command, replacing "d", if necessary, with the letter assigned 
      to your CD-ROM drive:

      d:\ia64\winnt32.exe 

   3. Press ENTER.

   4. Select Upgrade, and then click Next. 

   5. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

2.3 Collecting User and Computer Information
======================================================================

Windows XP Setup helps you gather information about you and
your computer. Although much of this installation process is
automatic, you might need to provide information or select settings on
the following pages, depending on the configuration of your computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to
     continue the setup process, select the option labeled "I accept
     this agreement."

   * Select Special Options. Customize the Windows XP installation,
     language, and accessibility settings for new installations. You
     can set up Windows XP to use multiple languages and regional
     settings.

   * Regional Settings. Change the system and user locale settings for
     different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person to 
     whom this copy of Windows XP is licensed and, optionally, the 
     organization.

   * Computer Name and Administrative Password. Type a unique computer
     name that differs from other computer, workgroup, or domain
     names on your network. Windows XP Setup suggests a computer name,
     but you can change the name.

     Setup automatically creates an Administrator account during 
     installation. When you use this account, you have full rights
     over the computer's settings and can create user accounts on the
     computer. Logging on as an Administrator after you install 
     Windows XP gives you administrative privileges that you need in 
     order to log on and manage your computer. Specify a password for
     the Administrator account. For security reasons, you should 
     always assign a password to the Administrator account. Take care
     to remember and protect your password.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you
     want Windows XP to automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

   * Networking Settings. Unless you are an advanced user, select
     Typical settings for your network configuration. To manually 
     configure network clients, services, and protocols, select 
     Custom settings.

   * Workgroup or Computer Domain. During the setup process, you must
     join either a workgroup or a domain. For details on both of these
     options, see "Providing Networking Information" in section 2.5 
     of this document.
     
   * Network Identification Wizard. If your computer is connected to a
     network, this wizard prompts you to identify the users who will
     be using your computer. Each person with an account on the
     computer can be assigned different levels of access.

2.4 Providing Networking Information
======================================================================

During or after the setup process, you need to join either a workgroup
or a domain. If you will not be working on a network, select the 
option to join a workgroup.

2.4.1 Joining a Workgroup
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A workgroup is one or more computers with the same workgroup name (for
example, a peer-to-peer network). Any user can join a workgroup by
simply typing the workgroup name--you don't need special permissions
to join a workgroup. You must provide an existing or new workgroup
name, or you can use the workgroup name that Windows XP Setup
suggests.

2.4.2 Joining a Domain
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A computer account identifies your computer to the domain, while the
user account identifies you to your computer.

A domain is a collection of computers defined by a network
administrator. Unlike joining a workgroup, which you can do yourself,
joining a domain requires permission from the network administrator.

To join a domain during the setup process, you must already have an
existing computer account in the domain you want to join, or have the
rights to create one. You are prompted to type a new computer account
name. Before you run Windows XP Setup, ask your network administrator
to create a computer account. Or, if you have the appropriate 
privileges, you can create the account during the setup process and 
join the domain. To join a domain, you need to provide your user name
and password.

      Note: If you have difficulty joining a domain during the setup
      process, join a workgroup instead, and then join the domain 
      after you finish installing Windows XP.

2.5 Creating a User Account
======================================================================

Your user account identifies your user name and password, the groups
you are a member of, which network resources you have access to, and
your personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified by
a user name and a password, both of which the user types when logging
on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts after
logging on to the computer by using an account with Administrator 
rights.

>> To create a user account: 

   1. Log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

   2. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click User Accounts. 

   3. If your computer is on a domain, click Add and then follow the 
      instructions that appear.

      If your computer is not on a domain, under Pick a task, click 
      Create a new account, and then follow the instructions that 
      Appear on your screen.

======================================================================
3.0 Advanced Setup Options 
======================================================================

This section provides more detailed information and can help you make 
decisions about how you install Windows XP.

3.1 File Systems
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, you should decide which 
file system you will use. A file system is the method by which 
information is stored on a hard disk.

Windows XP supports the NTFS file system or one of the file
allocation table file systems (FAT or FAT32). To set up a dual-boot 
configuration, you should select one file system for all your 
partitions: FAT32 or NTFS.

      NOTE: The 102 MB EFI system partition will automatically use the
      FAT file system. You should not change this, because using 
      another file system will cause problems.

3.1.1 NTFS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The NTFS file system is the recommended file system for use with
Windows XP. It has all of the basic capabilities of FAT, and it
provides the following advantages over the FAT and FAT32 file
systems:

   * Better file security
   * Better disk compression
   * Support for large hard disks, up to 2 terabytes (TB). (The
     maximum drive size for NTFS is much greater than for drives
     formatted as FAT, and as drive size increases, performance 
     with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with FAT.)

3.1.2 FAT and FAT32
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT file system that can be used
on drives ranging from 512 MB to 32 GB. FAT and FAT32 offer 
compatibility with operating systems other than Windows XP. 

3.2 Disk Partitions
======================================================================

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your hard disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. You can create a partition to
provide a place to back up data, or to dual-boot with another 
operating system. When you create partitions on a disk, you divide 
the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by 
a file system, such as FAT32 or NTFS.

During text-mode Setup, you can create and delete partitions. Follow 
these guidelines for partitioning:

*   A minimum of 6 GB is recommended for installing Windows XP 
    64-Bit Edition. A partition of this size provides flexibility 
    for adding future updates, operating system tools, or other 
    files.

*   During Setup, you should create and size only the partition on 
    which you want to install Windows XP. After Windows XP is 
    installed, you can use Disk Management to further partition the 
    unallocated space.

For more information about Disk Management, open Help and Support 
Center from the Start menu in Windows XP Help.

3.3 Modifying the EFI Boot Manager
======================================================================

The EFI Boot Manager enables you to boot to the shell, to Windows XP 
or another operating system, or to the CD-ROM drive. Your computer 
will attempt to boot to each of the listed options, starting with the 
first option, until it finds a valid bootable entry. You can change 
the order of items on the boot menu. For example, if you want to boot 
to the shell first, you can make Shell the first item on your boot 
menu. If you install more than one operating system, you can choose 
which is listed first.

You can also make other changes to the Boot Manager menu, such as 
renaming a boot option or exporting the boot options to a floppy disk.

>> To make changes to your boot options:

   1.  Boot to the EFI shell.

   2.  Switch to the hard disk. Your hard disk is normally located at 
       fs0 or fs1. For example, type

         fs0: 

       and then press ENTER.

   3.  Change to the Msutil folder. Type 

         cd msutil

       and then press ENTER.
       If there is no Msutil folder, you are not in the correct place.
       
       Try a different fs option.

   4.  Use the nvrboot.efi program to modify EFI Boot Manager options.
       To start it, type

            nvrboot

       and then press ENTER.

   5.  Make the changes to your boot options. For example, to rename 
       a boot option, type M to Modify, and then follow the directions
       that appear on your screen. To move a boot option to the top
       of the boot option menu, use the Push command. To save a copy
       of your boot options to a floppy disk, use the Export command.
