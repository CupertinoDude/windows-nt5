<P>If your CD recorder (burner) drive is not recognized as a recording drive in My Computer, Windows Media Player cannot be used to create audio CDs. To verify that your CD recorder drive is recognized, open My Computer, and in the <B>Devices with Removable Storage</B> area, right-click the drive, and then click <B>Properties</B>. If your CD recorder is recognized, you will see a <B>Recording</B> tab.</P>

<P>If you are having problems copying to CDs and your CD recorder is recognized in My Computer, verify that the <B>Enable CD recording on this drive</B> check box is selected in the <B>Properties</B> dialog box for that drive.</P>

<H3><A NAME="silent_copies_of_tracks_fbxp"></A> Silent copies of tracks</H3>

<P>If the CD-ROM drive on your computer is set to use digital mode and Windows Media Player is set to use analog mode while copying tracks, the tracks might copy without sound. The CD-ROM drive and Windows Media Player should both be set to use analog mode. If you want to use analog mode in Windows Media Player, change the CD-ROM drive to use analog mode also. When analog mode is used for copying CDs in Windows Media Player, some sound cards and microphones also record background noises. </P>

<P>See the following procedures for information on adjusting these settings.</P>

<P class="proclabel">To set your playback or copying settings to digital mode in Windows Media Player:</p>
<OL>
	<LI>On the <B>Tools</B> menu, click <B>Options</B>, and then click the <B>Devices</B> tab.</li>

<H3><A NAME="rage3_based_display_cards_alug"></A> Rage3&#0150;based display cards</H3>

<P>The use of Rage3&#0150;based display cards as secondary adapters in a multi monitor environment has been disabled for stability reasons. If you used a Rage3 card previously, you must set it up as the primary adapter. </P>

<P>To do this, change the BIOS to post to the Rage3 as the VGA&#0150;enabled device and disable VGA for other adapters present in the system. Some adapters will do this automatically while others will need to have jumper settings adjusted.</P>

<P>Please contact your video adapter vendor for more information on disabling the VGA.</P>

<H2><A NAME="antivirus_programs_rlzg"></A> Antivirus programs</H2>

<P><B>Products</B>: Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition, Windows&nbsp;XP Professional only</P>

<P>On computers running Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition or Windows&nbsp;XP Professional, only antivirus programs written for the specific operating system run correctly. Antivirus drivers not written to run on the specific Windows&nbsp;XP operating system might cause problems. Other issues might include a lack of real-time scanning for viruses or system vulnerability to virus attack. These problems range in severity from recoverable errors to loss of some or all of the data, to the computer becoming unusable. Contact your antivirus software vendor for updates.</P>

<H2><A NAME="microsoft_agent_zhoq"></A> Microsoft Agent</H2>

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP provides inbox support for SAPI version 5.0 speech engines and programs only. To avoid loss of functionality in Microsoft Agent applications that use speech input and/or output engines, you must install SAPI version 4.0a runtime support and then install the SAPI 4.0 speech engines. <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=3354" TARGET="_blank"><U>Click here</U></A> to install the SAPI version 4.0a runtime support from the Microsoft Web site. You might also need to reinstall previously existing SAPI 4.0 speech engines, even if they were working with Microsoft Agent prior to upgrading to Windows&nbsp;XP.</P>

<H2><A NAME="smtp_authentication_iabx"></A> SMTP authentication</H2>

<P><B>Products</B>: Windows&nbsp;XP Professional only</P>

<P>The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service in Windows&nbsp;XP can be configured to require clients to authenticate before issuing mail commands. When you install or upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP Professional in a workgroup, the authentication options NTLM (formerly called Windows&nbsp;NT LAN Manager) and GSSAPI (Generic Security Services API) do not work because a registry key is set that forces guest only authentication.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, set the force guest authentication registry key. For more information, see article Q304707, &quot;SMTP Authentication Configuration on Windows&nbsp;XP Professional Edition,&quot; in the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=1856" TARGET="_blank"><U>Microsoft Knowledge Base</U></A>.</P>

<P>Local device drive names (a letter of the alphabet) are usually assigned incrementally starting from the letter C, and network drive names are automatically assigned starting from Z in reverse order (Z, Y, etc.). </P>

<P>Drive letter conflicts with existing network shares might result when connecting digital cameras or other consumer devices that use memory sticks to Windows&nbsp;XP while the computer is turned on. The same conflict might occur when adding external drives (such as USB or 1394 disks). In the event of a naming conflict with an existing network share, the local device will not be accessible. </P>

If you are running Windows&nbsp;NT version 4.0, you should break any mirrors and back up all data on stripe, RAID5, or extended volume sets before upgrading to Windows&nbsp;XP. Ftdisk sets might not be accessible after the upgrade.</P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP 64-Bit Edition does not support most 16-bit DOS, Windows, and OS/2 applications. This is also significant to 32-bit applications where the initial setup.exe is a 16-bit stub which checks the machine type, then launches a 32-bit install engine to perform the install.</P>

<P>Some 32-bit applications ship with device drivers that are not supported by the 64-bit kernel.
