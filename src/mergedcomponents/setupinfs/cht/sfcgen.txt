; *Reason For Exclusion, gapi32.dll* - Workaround the fact that Exchange and Outlook 
; ship different versions of this file.  Win2000 needs this file for Far East IME support.

; RayCo's comments:
;   Here is what I propose, if and only if, Win2000 has no dependency on this file.
;   It is too late to remove this file from the product as we would not have time to
;   see what apps break.  Unprotect the file for Win2000 and remove it for Win2001. 
;   Exchange and Outlook would be entirely repsonsible for making sure they are both 
;   in sync and don't mess each other up by putting incompatible files on Windows 2000.
