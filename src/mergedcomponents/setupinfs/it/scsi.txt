#if 0

  This file is organized into two main blocks. The first block contains
    code (non-string) sections which are specific to languages. Please put
    the code sections in the correct language.
  The second block is reserved for [Strings] which localizers will be
    working with. It is further divided using "#if LANGUAGE ==" for language
    specific strings. For strings which are common to all languages
    place outside the #ifs.

  This file is first precompiled with LANGUAGE_ID
  set to the language (see inf\win4\inf\makefile.inc for details).
  For example, for usa builds, the sections under #if LANGUAGE == 0x409
  will appear.

  Important: To support locstudio, this file contains only ONE [Strings] section.
