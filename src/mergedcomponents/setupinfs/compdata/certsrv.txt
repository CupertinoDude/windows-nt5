Certificate Server 1.0 cannot be upgraded directly from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows XP Server. If you continue, your Certificate Server settings will not be saved, and Certificate Server will be automatically uninstalled. If you upgrade first to Windows XP and then upgrade to Windows XP Server, all your Certificate Server settings will be preserved.
