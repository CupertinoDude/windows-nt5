Microsoft Windows XP Setup has detected Windows NT 4.0 basic volumes in your computer. These volumes might include volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity.

If you proceed with this installation, these volumes will not be accessible in Microsoft Windows XP. You can use ftonline to access these volumes to either save the data or convert these basic volumes to dynamic. 
 
You can also choose to cancel Setup, back up the contents of each volume, and delete these volumes before restarting Setup. After completing Setup, you can reconfigure these volumes using dynamic disks and restore the contents. See Microsoft Windows XP Help for more details.

It is recommended that you back up the contents of each volume before proceeding with Microsoft Windows XP Setup.
