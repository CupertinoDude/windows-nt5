<P>
Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Setup has detected Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 basic volumes on your computer. These volumes might include volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity.
</P>

<P>
If you proceed with this installation, these volumes will not be accessible in Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP. You can use ftonline to access these volumes to either save the data or convert these basic volumes to dynamic. 
</P>

<P>
You can also choose to cancel Setup, back up the contents of each volume, and delete these volumes before restarting Setup. After completing Setup, you can reconfigure these volumes using dynamic disks and restore the contents. See Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Help for more details.
</P>

<P>
It is recommended that you back up the contents of each volume before proceeding with Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Setup.
