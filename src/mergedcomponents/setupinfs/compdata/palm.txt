HotSync Manager, a component that synchronizes 3Com Palm computing devices with your computer, allows Palm devices to synchronize with a network. After upgrading to Microsoft Windows XP, network synchronization will fail because the device will have problems locating its primary computer.

To solve this problem, synchronize the device through the serial port before attempting a network synchronization.

For a list of devices supported by this version of Windows, see the Microsoft Windows XP Hardware Compatibility List at the Microsoft Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=whistler&ar=help&sba=compatible.
