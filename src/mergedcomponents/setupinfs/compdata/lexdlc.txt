The port monitor Lexmark TCP/IP Network Port is no longer available in this version of Microsoft Windows and the software associated with this port will no longer run after the upgrade. If you are using this port monitor, check to see if the device can use the Microsoft Standard TCP/IP port monitor and change the port configuration settings for each printer queue after setup has completed. If you are unsure what protocol this device supports, visit Lexmark's Web site for more information.

For a list of software supported by this version of Windows see the Microsoft Windows Product Compatibility List at http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=whistler&ar=help&sba=compatible.
