This computer is running the Microsoft Site Server Internet Locator Service (ILS). This service is not available with Microsoft Windows XP and it will be disabled once you upgrade this computer to XP. Therefore, if you are running applications that require ILS, you should maintain at least one server in your organization that can run ILS. For example, you should consider maintaining an ILS server in the following cases:

 o If you are running NetMeeting version 2.11 or earlier.
 o If you are running TAPI 3.0-based applications, such as Phone Dialer.

Windows XP includes TAPI version 3.1. TAPI 3.1 supports ILS, and it supports TAPI application directory partitions. If you plan to upgrade all servers in your organization to XP and therefore lose the ability to run ILS, you must configure a TAPI application directory partition on a XP domain controller to support your clients.
