The currently installed driver for the Glint based display adapter is not compatible with this version of Microsoft Windows and will be disabled during the upgrade.
		 
Note:

* If the adapter uses the Permedia 2 Chipset, Windows XP Setup will
install a Permedia 2 driver provided by Microsoft.
* If the adapter is based on the Glint series of adapters, your video display will remain in VGA mode after upgrade to Windows XP is completed.
		 
For more information about this driver, contact the manufacturer.
