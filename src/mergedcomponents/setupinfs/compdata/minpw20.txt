A printer using the file sdnt4.dll, which has been installed on your system, will not function properly under Microsoft Windows XP using the printer driver that is currently installed.  You can replace the driver with an updated version, or Windows XP will install a compatible driver if one is available.

To obtain a more recent version of the printer drivers for your device, please contact the manufacturer.
