The currently installed driver for the UMAX VistaScan version 2.40 scanner is not compatible with this version of Microsoft Windows and will be disabled during the upgrade. Windows XP Setup will install a new UMAX DS driver so that your scanner will function correctly after the upgrade is complete. However, Umax might have a newer version of the VistaScan software that runs under Windows XP.
