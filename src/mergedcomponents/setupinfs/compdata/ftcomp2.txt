Microsoft Windows XP Setup has detected Windows NT 4.0 basic volumes in your system, boot or paging drives. These volumes might include basic spanned, mirrored, striped, or RAID-5 volumes.

You must break any boot or system mirrored volume and move the paging files to simple partitions before installing Microsoft Windows XP. After completing Setup, you can reconfigure these volumes using dynamic disks.
