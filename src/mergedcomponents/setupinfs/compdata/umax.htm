<P>
The currently installed driver for the UMAX VistaScan version 2.40 scanner is not compatible with this version of Microsoft Windows and will be disabled during the upgrade. Windows&nbsp;XP Setup will install a new UMAX DS driver so that your scanner will function correctly after the upgrade is complete. However, Umax might have a newer version of the VistaScan software that runs under Windows&nbsp;XP.
