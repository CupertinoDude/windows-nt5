# "TARGETPATH" is where your binary output file will be put (under subdirectories
# indicating the CPU architecture (e.g., i386) and Checked vs. Free 
# NOTE: You may get an error when you try to build stating that the "Sample.Sys"
# file cannot be opened.  That may be due to the subdirectories under the
# one specified below have not been created.  To fix this, manually create
# the directory under the TARGETPATH directory as follows:
#  $(TARGETPATH)\i386\checked   (if you're running a checked build)
#  $(TARGETPATH)\i386\free      (if you're running a free build)
